You can make a leaders out of man with reasonable common-sense and decency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Most of part is taken from summarized transcript by fellow youtuber at video with little changes from my side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to manekshaw sir qualities of leader&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Professional competence&lt;/strong> : He provided example of Defence Minister. That minister had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it.&lt;/strong> : 👉🏻 Act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong. 👉🏻 why a person don’t take decision?? because he lacks confidence!! why? because he lacks professional knowledge. 👉🏻 If you must be a &lt;strong>bloody fool&lt;/strong> be must quickly - manekshawism
Absolute justice and impartiality: People may not like you but you would be respected.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Courage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 moral courage: Ability to distinguish right from wrong. Then standby it, irrespective of what others think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 yes man, is a horrible man. He may rise very high, but will never become leader. He will be used by superior and disliked by colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 He mentioned story, when he was summoned. This was during east Pakistan crisis, by Indira Gandhi and cabinet ministers. Cabinet ministers in meeting expected him to be agree to intervene in april month. This not prudent and he boldly put forward his dissent about choice of time rather than being yes-man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 physical courage: Everyone is scared, he tells he was scared too. To be a leader, one to have to physical courageous in face of adversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He mentioned a story, where his subordinate threatened that he would kill him. That chap was big but he despite being scared, he made him santri for night. Also asked him to bring tea and hot water to him in morning. He had option to have more security around him, but he showed he has courage and also showing trust in his men. Funnily he goes on to say, don’t be fool-hardy like he was but we need to understand the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Loyalty&lt;/strong> : Its two way thing, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he is also loyal to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management of men and sources: He mostly conveyed about role of emotional intelligence. Human have problems so being stern should be combined with human touch and sense of humour play a great role in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Discipline and Character&lt;/strong> No amount leadership would put things right, the two other important aspect(that we usually lack)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>👉🏻 Discipline&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discipline is code of conduct for decent living in society one with the other. This code of conduct has come from generation to generation, it’s come from holy books. It gets refined on as cultures change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Example: Non-punctuality is an act of ill-discipline. Very harmful for society and nation.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>👉🏻 Character&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should be honest, truthful etc. The big picture is, knowing what you are. Do not let fans or hangers-on put you on pedestals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Do watch the video, if you have time. You can learn lessons on how to communicates. Sweet little jokes he cracks, makes it far insightful than above mentioned transcript&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
