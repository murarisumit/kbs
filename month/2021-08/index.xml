Can relate to him, seems like a neighbourhood elder brother(bhaiya) who you can talk to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What he mentioned was, spend on skills. More like one message in a 3-idiot movie. Run after excellence, success will come to you. He isn&amp;rsquo;t sadhu and adds on to say to buy material assets like cars or houses. If a house gives peace of mind, improves quality of life, go buy a house. If cars make your life easy, use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important thing he mentioned is, we have to make money work for us to be financially independent and financial freedom is about being content. There are endless materialistic traps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to few more bits to the post. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvBZjKXVyP8&amp;t=399s">There are three important assets&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We need to optimise on these three bits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ankurwarikoo 41 Things at 41</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/1e0b24f24f6a5963366cc66d84ad098f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 16:56:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/1e0b24f24f6a5963366cc66d84ad098f/</guid><description>&lt;p>Read it somewhere, you can&amp;rsquo;t make mistakes. You&amp;rsquo;ve to learn from others&amp;rsquo; mistakes/experiences. Read this post from &lt;a href="https://ankurwarikoo.com/contact/">ankur warikoo&lt;/a>, so thought of writing about it, to internalize it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The only success for a company is when it raises money from customers. Congratulations when raising from money from founder is like, congratulating chef on buying vegetables&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Useful&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When you share your failure openly, you instantly take away all the power that the world had over you.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s similar to 8 mile &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1ROLEDyP4&amp;t=170s">last rap battle&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Managing your time is about managing your energy, managing your energy is about managing your attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For me also, it is all about your focus and this is especially relevant in time where there are all fun and good youtube videos around to take your time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Take criticism seriously but not personally&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This has been my journey, has been detached from surroundings but still not taking unwarranted criticism(which you don&amp;rsquo;t agree to) personally should be part of my journey. Understanding it&amp;rsquo;s their opinion and still choice is with me how I take it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also need to internalise response vs react. Always respond not react. You should not give anyone power over you, on how you response, that should only be yours and yours only.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>World doesn&amp;rsquo;t need one more template, world need one more rebel&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a good food for thought #food-for-thought&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Never complain&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remember this, have learnt it the hard way. Whatever it is, just don&amp;rsquo;t complain. It would never fix things, just aggravate them. Learn to handle them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The decision that will hurt you the most is not making one while waiting to take the right one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>FOr waiting for the right time, has hurt more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">One of the most frequently asked questions to me is: “How do you manage to wake up early?”
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Logic says several answers to it:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Keep your workout gear next to your bed
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Alarm clock in another room
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Burpees on waking up, etc.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">All of these work, until they don’t.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">The true question to address is “How to sleep on time?”
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">If you’re sleeping at 11 and want to wake up at 4, the motivation will certainly stop on Day 4.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">What if we get a night-time schedule, that makes it impossible to sleep late? Something like:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Having dinner 2-3 hours prior to planned bed time
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Spending time doing activities that relax you
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Planning for the next day
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">It turns out, if we turn to twist the outputs without changing the inputs, the motivation won’t lasts.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">The more we strive to get the inputs right, the more the outputs automatically take care of themselves.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Can attest to it, this has been the only thing working for me. If I sleep late, then its better to assume that mornings are gone now, nothing can be done, take it as holiday tomorrow. This also cements the idea in me that &lt;code>my today defines my tomorrow&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mornings are the most beautiful and productive part of the day, and following is my routine, it might help you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday night&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Have dinner by 6:30-7:00 and if it&amp;rsquo;s late go for a fruit diet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read books, listen to music, enjoy time with family, and basically spend time doing activities that relax you (as ankur mentioned).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having milk before sleeping with turmeric is good. Somehow flavour is good to me, also a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosha">khapa guy&lt;/a>, so that works for me, might now work for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan things for tomorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mornings&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wake up by 3:30/4/4:30, pick tasks you&amp;rsquo;ve planned and chop them off. You get beautiful those feel-good feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go and see the sun rise, for me it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful and other &lt;a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/beautiful">adjectives&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise after saying &lt;strong>hi&lt;/strong> to the sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook food and be happy as you are so lucky to have that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before eating, take a bath and freshen up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat food and now the day starts for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan is to add morning prayers into this, but don&amp;rsquo;t have a pooja room in the house(have to do something for it.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Afternoon&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This time is sold to someone else for money(sad but that&amp;rsquo;s case for now[27-Aug-2021])&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If I sleep late,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No fun mornings, admitting I have missed all of that for today.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No alarm, but body sleep is important to me, no alarm to disturb it. Have done my deeds. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, let this morning go. Nothing can be done about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you can try to do something meaningful during the day, do that and remember most importantly sleep on time to enjoy your next morning.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Firefox provides easy way for searching the bookmarking, history or open tabs using the address bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For searching bookmarks only&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Press &lt;code>Cmd/Ctrl + L&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press &lt;code>*&lt;/code> the search would come only for bookmarks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Similarly we can search for history, open tags or title using special character mentioned below&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Add % to show only matches in your currently open tabs.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Add # to show only matches where every search term is part of the title or part of a tag.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Add $ to show only matches where every search term is part of the web address (URL). The text &amp;#34;https://&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;http://&amp;#34; in the URL is ignored but not &amp;#34;file:///&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Add ? to show only search suggestions.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Excerpts from notion kbs&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Confidence is the key, if you believe in you the world will believe in you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Perception is reality, how people perceive you is how they behave around you and that is real, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if their perception is an accurate depiction of you or not because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. People do action, real world action based on it. Hence the &lt;strong>Perception is reality or Perception becomes the reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I learnt it the hard way, when people perceive you in a certain way and action, real actions are taken because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What people perceive of you are from your actions, at least this is the case with me. Your thoughts are not visible out there, only your actions. You can speak of your intention, and some people may buy it but not for long. Actions are more powerful than words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Competitive Programming to Play Around Sometimes</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/3654465ae54a20816f5b8cc307dabaa3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 05:44:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/3654465ae54a20816f5b8cc307dabaa3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Moving it from notion kbs to store here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's Not What I Am Underneath it's What I Do Defines Me</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/9aed16443012e51a38b0c189b58f95ab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 04:55:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/9aed16443012e51a38b0c189b58f95ab/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have come to the conclusion that everyone sees a different movie in their head, even if they watch the same movie.

&lt;p>Used to think that what&amp;rsquo;s in head/thoughts matters but as grown up come to conclusion that &lt;strong>no actions matters&lt;/strong>, what you do defines you &lt;strong>not just what you think&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t let your future disturb you. You will meet if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against present&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If sometimes your future haunts you, for me personally someone close to me told a prophecy about me and it haunted me way longer than it should, hence was able to connect to it. IMO these things haunt the weak more than man of actions and yes reading does empower you against such weak thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This quote from bhagavad geeta helps me keep on the right track, and yes evening prayers do help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन |
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि || 47 ||&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You have a right to perform your prescribed duties&lt;/strong>, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the future haunts you, remember, that is not in your control. No worry/stress can solve it. Only things that can help you are your actions and what you choose to do. Remember the only thing that is in your control are your actions coupled with weapons/fruit of reason/बुद्धि no more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No worry can solve issues other than your actions which are in your control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dark Knight Rises the Climb Scene</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/82f13670d5d8ce84febcb23889eea474/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 03:35:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/82f13670d5d8ce84febcb23889eea474/</guid><description>&lt;p>One more youtube video, batman this time.

Hugo has got support for this and designed in such a way that really make sense to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documentation for this is here: &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to reference some post, you need to know about &lt;strong>file path of that post&lt;/strong>. Proper reading would have made it easier but spent around 2hrs for this stupid things.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The ref and relref shortcodes require a single parameter: the path to a content document, with or without a file extension, with or without an anchor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead of &lt;strong>filepath&lt;/strong> went along with URL of the output file, and wasted all effort there, did all I could and later to realise that linking by URL doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense, path makes sense.

&lt;p>To achieve to be highly successful in corporate world i.e. reach at high position in social order one has to put insane amount of work, he mentioned 80 hours work week, translates to ~ 12 hours every day without breaks for years and with &lt;strong>focus&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>determination&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;del>hello&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn&amp;rsquo;t like when kids go to work to the library to study for 6 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>High social order always means different from different cultures. India had a weird culture once, people who left the material world and lived for pursuit of knowledge were treated on high pecking order, but that is for a very evolved state of culture. Mostly it would refer to high financial or political position.
Disclaimer: Today India is in a very sad state w.r.t its culture and the same system has become the biggest baggage.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Will Mahatma Gandhi be treated in a higher social order than Bill Gates or Sir Albert Einstein ?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>One needs to make decision,&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either earn good enough money to enjoy life and then learn music, take care of body, tap-dancing, beautiful literature, learning physics, getting close to oneself/god&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Be insane and work like crazy and get up in pecking order&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Or third he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention having a middle ground, keep working your whole life because you enjoy it and reach in high pecking order. While taking care of your body, mind, being calm and happy all along in life. Is this route possible ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8">Happiness Unlimited&lt;/a> had a very huge impact on me, during my college years, but is this route possible? &lt;strong>This would good exploration in my life&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;pre>&lt;code> First of all my background - I've been working on Amazon for years and know all the tricks of getting ranked. I do not engage in black hat tactics and I did the review game when it wasnt against TOS. As soon as they changed everything, I did not engage. However because of all my contacts I'm in the know for a lot of things. Getting reviews and the strategies used is one of those things.
I noticed this brand popping up in searches a while back when it had only 5 reviews. I went into search mode after reading reviews and tried to figure out where this company came from.
Their website lists no address but says that they adhere to standards in BC, Canada. I searched more and found an office address in Chinatown in Vancouver. I kept searching and found the business is registered to a 'investment group'.
The suspicious thing was how all the first reviews were worded. People saying it's the best they ever tried and they looked for a long time and found this brand... but if the brand is only on Amazon and they searched... how did they find it? It wasnt ranked organically where you could find it until it had a ton of reviews.
The reviews are also spaced out perfectly. There's 1-3 reviews a day and all 5 star reviews. I can tell you from working on Amazon for years that different categories have different review rates. For CPG products, the review rate is extremely small. You might get 1 review for every 1000 products sold. So seeing a brand with no history getting so many daily reviews that are all around the same length and push the same BS... these are all paid for reviews.
Finally, the kicker is that I responded to a handful of these reviews in the comments, only for them all to disappear within a week. Usually when Amazon removes something, they'll send you a notification. There was no notification... and this is how it's done. There's shady Amazon employees that will remove comments and sellers for a fee. I know this because I know someone in China that offers this service. Chances are, these Hong Kong people that own this company also have made the same contacts I have and are using that have them taken down.
So wait and watch over the next month as the reviews keep piling in, unless of course they find this thread and stop.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item><item><title>How Engine Works</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/1125b6a1a9edde68c82b00c6e62a2f2e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 04:33:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/1125b6a1a9edde68c82b00c6e62a2f2e/</guid><description>&lt;p>Beautiful things, always read 4 strokes work, but seeing this video(click title to go to video) gave so much more clarity and satisfaction.

&lt;li>Probably better for search engines to get results(who know anyways, it would make sense having URL as params to search result imo)&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Values have to fixed, not modification(important for me).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Still structure are not fixed for me, so don&amp;rsquo;t want to tie myself with title or path or director.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Cross-referencing become difficult&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Cross referencing is important to me, and with keeping other param than UUID would be difficult to maintain, as it might break URL on this website(which is last thing I want), hence opting to machine generated &lt;a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/generating-a-unique-number-or-string/7930/6">unique ID from hugo&lt;/a> i.e. &lt;code>{{ .File.UniqueID }}&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Linux load averages are &amp;ldquo;system load averages&amp;rdquo; that show the running thread (task) demand on the system as an average number of running plus waiting threads. This measures demand, which can be greater than what the system is currently processing. Most tools show three averages, for 1, 5, and 15 minutes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some interpretations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the averages are 0.0, then your system is idle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the 1 minute average is higher than the 5 or 15 minute averages, then load is increasing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the 1 minute average is lower than the 5 or 15 minute averages, then load is decreasing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If they are higher than your CPU count, then you might have a performance problem (it depends).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="making-sense-of-linux-load-averages">Making sense of Linux load averages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up with OSes where load averages meant CPU load averages, so the Linux version has always bothered me. Perhaps the real problem all along is that the words &amp;ldquo;load averages&amp;rdquo; are about as ambiguous as &amp;ldquo;I/O&amp;rdquo;. Which type of I/O? Disk I/O? File system I/O? Network I/O? &amp;hellip; Likewise, which load averages? CPU load averages? System load averages? Clarifying it this way lets me make sense of it like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>On Linux, load averages are (or try to be) &amp;quot;system load averages&amp;quot;, for the system as a whole, measuring the number of threads that are working and waiting to work (CPU, disk, uninterruptible locks). Put differently, it measures the number of threads that aren't completely idle. Advantage: includes demand for different resources.
On other OSes, load averages are &amp;quot;CPU load averages&amp;quot;, measuring the number of CPU running + CPU runnable threads. Advantage: can be easier to understand and reason about (for CPUs only).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that there&amp;rsquo;s another possible type: &amp;ldquo;physical resource load averages&amp;rdquo;, which would include load for physical resources only (CPU + disk).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps one day we&amp;rsquo;ll add additional load averages to Linux, and let the user choose what they want to use: a separate &amp;ldquo;CPU load averages&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;disk load averages&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;network load averages&amp;rdquo;, etc. Or just use different metrics altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-metrics">Better Metrics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Linux load averages increase, you know you have higher demand for resources (CPUs, disks, and some locks), but you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure which. You can use other metrics for clarification. For example, for CPUs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>per-CPU utilization: eg, using mpstat -P ALL 1
per-process CPU utilization: eg, top, pidstat 1, etc.
per-thread run queue (scheduler) latency: eg, in /proc/PID/schedstats, delaystats, perf sched
CPU run queue latency: eg, in /proc/schedstat, perf sched, my runqlat bcc tool.
CPU run queue length: eg, using vmstat 1 and the 'r' column, or my runqlen bcc tool.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item><item><title>K8s Failure Stories</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/k8s-failure-stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:37:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/k8s-failure-stories/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Awesome Kubernetes</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/awesome-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:16:59 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/awesome-kubernetes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Awesome Docker Compose</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/awesome-docker-compose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:16:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/awesome-docker-compose/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Solar System if Moon Was Only One Pixel</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/solar-system-if-moon-was-only-one-pixel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 23:50:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/solar-system-if-moon-was-only-one-pixel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Saw this visualization long-back and was storing things up here(&lt;a href="https://www.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/)">https://www.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/)&lt;/a>, now moving them up here now.

&lt;p>There are three things&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prevalence : How common is that disease around here? What chance of having it without tests?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sensitivity : If even disease is present, how good is the test at detecting it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Specificity : If a test is taken, there can be other issues that result. Clots in the pancreas can be because of a lot many things. How specific is test for that specific disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For example which he told&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prevalence : 1%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sensitivity : 90%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Specificity : 91%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>So even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken test, there is &lt;strong>1%&lt;/strong> chance of you having that disease. So taking a test based on the test&amp;rsquo;s Sensitivity and Specificity would increase and decrease that probability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To calculate your probability faster is to get the Bayes factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Bayes factor = Sensitivity / False positive
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Bayes factor = (Probability of having cancer after test is positive) / (Probability of not having cancer after test is positive)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Bayes factor is also called likelihood ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For above values :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Probability of having cancer after test is positive : 90 in 100 (90%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Probability of test is false positive (100 - specificity) i.e 9&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So likelihood ratio is : 90 / 0 i.e. 10&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So in the first case without test, there was 1% i.e. 1 in 100 that you&amp;rsquo;ve cancer without test. After the test, your chances just get updated. After test is positive your chances are: 1/100 * 10 ~ 1/10. So that is also not 100% sure now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for tests your symptoms, contacts, genetics all come up to increase the chance, but still not 100%, we need to remember. &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;All tests do is update the chances of having it, but not sure shot thing. Until tests are bulletproof.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As a doctor I&amp;rsquo;m so happy you&amp;rsquo;re using your platform to get this information out. Let me tell you though&amp;hellip; it gets way more complicated! Unfortunately prevalence estimates aren&amp;rsquo;t always known and are constantly changing (especially in pandemics). Another thing to consider is the gold standard. If your test looks for breast cancer you can cut out the lump and look at it under a microscope. Some diseases aren&amp;rsquo;t as easily clarified. For instance, since we don&amp;rsquo;t have a highly accurate, easy test for pancreatic cancer we rely on imaging, demographics, blood markers, symptoms (or lack thereof) as multiple things that form a conglomerate test to increase our Bayes factor. Despite all these things we can&amp;rsquo;t always get a great prediction on whether that scar in your bile duct is cancer or just a residual scar from pancreatitis you had 10 years ago. So we offer the patient a huge surgery to remove the head of their pancreas and duodenum only to find that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cancer. You can imagine the patient is happy it&amp;rsquo;s not cancer but not so happy they don&amp;rsquo;t have half their pancreas and have abdominal pain and maybe diabetes. Medicine is a tricky thing. Another tricky thing is operator error. Some tests depend on the skill of the lab tech, radiologist, or surgeon. The complexity of the human body and the uniqueness of each individual also plays a role. Your test may be false positive in a particular patient 100% of the time because they have some strange protein mutation. It&amp;rsquo;s tough!&lt;/p>

No one knows the future, it&amp;rsquo;s so obvious, still people are into prediction/criticism business and it&amp;rsquo;s working well too.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In 1909 Washington Post wrote &amp;ldquo;There will never be such a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue to drag it&amp;rsquo;s slow weight across the patient path&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is also not now, it&amp;rsquo;s been since the 1900s, over centuries, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to spread pessimism, criticize people around even if they are working for their vision/dream. They don&amp;rsquo;t even need one bad event for it; their prediction business is just on. If they get a bad event, oh my. One just need to realize this dead-simple thing: &amp;quot; &lt;strong>no-one knows about future&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everybody&amp;rsquo;s is guessing, some have seen similar thing before but still based on past experience they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>guessing&lt;/strong> nothing more. These are modern future predictors with some probability not even odds, so the important lesson is to trust our instincts and move across.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a good chance of failing here too, but at-least now understanding our own intuition is better than before and as everyone bet&amp;rsquo;s, mine bet was also on table.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>India's Maiden Indigenous Aircraft Carrier</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/india-maiden-indigenous-aircraft-carrier/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 22:48:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/india-maiden-indigenous-aircraft-carrier/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s is good to see fellow country man are working are making things are aircraft carrier, weighing 40000 tonnes in itself looks like huge engineering and manufacturing feat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Homelabs Setup</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/homelabs-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 22:24:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/homelabs-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>For sometime having ideas of using homelabs, found this guide useful but have other important priorities right now.

Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Because of distraction, you actually context switch from one task to other, which lower your focus on work you&amp;rsquo;re doing or we can say one is not able to deliver to our fullest potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to deliver our fullest potential, psychological effect like anxiety, distress chip in, which are far more disastrous for short and long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It also starts a vicious cycle, the more anxiety and distress we feel the more we go for these distractions. In the short-term we don&amp;rsquo;t see problems, we play games, enjoy movies, adore photos, but the problem doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Problems are still there, and we have even less time to solve them than before. This is a far more powerful/dangerous enemy than smoke ever was, because we don&amp;rsquo;t even need to go shop for this, it&amp;rsquo;s at our smartphone, just next to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This continuous loop, then reduces our ability to focus and concentrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So the problem is defined and most of us are aware of it and we need solutions. One such technique if you have lower focus time is to use pomodoro technique, created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short note on pomodoro technique which helps me&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fix tasks you want to work on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work in done is this timebox manner: &lt;strong>loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15 )&lt;/strong> OR &lt;strong>loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15-)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus work for 25 mins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take 5 mins break, no phones here, usually a little walk, sometimes water and relax at times&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continue this for 3 times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take a longer break for the 4th time. Continue and repeat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Which have this repairability in mind. This laptop specially looks with it&amp;rsquo;s modularity. As iFixit says, this is slippery slope, we have seen many such initiatives come and go. So hoping this company works and changes consumer electronics industry for good.&lt;/p>
