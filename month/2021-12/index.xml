      <description>&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t harm anyone, which it right. One should not. To add-in man should be harmless either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be dangerous and monstrous but in civilised manner. All the human we look up to aren&amp;rsquo;t harmless. Shri Ram is great archer and capable to defeating whole kingdom. Shri krishna said to have single handedly changed course of mahabharata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all heard stories of third eye of shiva. His ange can bring havoc. The message is harmless men are not virtuous. It&amp;rsquo;s the dangerous man under control that are virtuous and human to look upto.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Company Similar to East India Company</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company&#34;&gt;United fruit company&lt;/a&gt;. Created railroads, port, and other infra in Central American countries for plundering them. Owning the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to draw comparison to what &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt; did in India but on the smaller scale. Not killing millions of people, but still very brutal for any human being. I see them and see Hitler and can&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still can see how people think United fruit company and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt;  were the force of good. They did good for those countries they were plundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video also shows the side where we see how US imperialism works. How they destabilize the country. Quite an eye-opener for someone who grew up to see the USA as a sort-of force of good and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So yes, if someone is really persistant about it. The prices for these weaponised exploit start from 100K USD from from 2.5Million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is high cost to it, so usually used by state actor or for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t live in fear of getting hacked, it should be in your threat model. There are lot more important people our there with more information is their hands so you&amp;rsquo;re very less likely are a target, but remember if someone wants to he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is pure economics involved, will it bring enough ROI(Return of investment on it). Are you a person of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all you can do ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser has huge attack surface. If you can disable JS, probably disabling javascript, but that seems difficult. Use umatrix can make it easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable just-in time compiler, or webassembly or browser if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t click stupid links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use multi-factor auth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack persistance is hard, but just restart it every now and then. It might help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most simpler tricks are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtm4X6L_Cs&#34;&gt;Phishing&lt;/a&gt; you should be worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
