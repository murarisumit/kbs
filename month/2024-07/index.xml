&lt;p>Are you trying to pursue many different directions at once?
Are you frustrated that the world wants you to pick one thing, because you want to do them all?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The problem is thinking short term — assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The solution is to think long term. Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You may have heard this story: Buridan’s donkey is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water. It keeps looking left and right, trying to decide between hay and water. Unable to decide, it eventually dies of hunger and thirst.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A donkey can’t think of the future. If he could, he’d realize he could first drink the water, then go eat the hay. He’d live.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Don’t be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience.&lt;br>
Think ahead. Plan. Use the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and under-estimate what they can do in ten years.
Think long-term. Use the future.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
