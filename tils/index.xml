&lt;p>First part is getting raw, either by cotton tree, or silk worm or cashmere/kashmir goats or sheeps etc.&lt;/p>

Hugo has got support for this and designed in such a way that really make sense to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documentation for this is here: &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to reference some post, you need to know about &lt;strong>file path of that post&lt;/strong>. Proper reading would have made it easier but spent around 2hrs for this stupid things.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The ref and relref shortcodes require a single parameter: the path to a content document, with or without a file extension, with or without an anchor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead of &lt;strong>filepath&lt;/strong> went along with URL of the output file, and wasted all effort there, did all I could and later to realise that linking by URL doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense, path makes sense. Even if tomorrow you can permalink style, it won&amp;rsquo;t impact your reference link in hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;path-to-file.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> or &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;path-to-file&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> both work fine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for anchor tags: &lt;code>[text]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;path-to-file&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trust Your Instincts Instead of Hearsay</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/trust-your-instincts-instead-of-hearsay/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 02:33:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/trust-your-instincts-instead-of-hearsay/</guid><description>&lt;p>More my understanding of the world grows by reading various prophecies people have made before, makes me realize that there is no point in taking hearsay seriously, be it from news channels, be it anywhere else. No one knows the future, it&amp;rsquo;s so obvious, still people are into prediction/criticism business and it&amp;rsquo;s working well too.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In 1909 Washington Post wrote &amp;ldquo;There will never be such a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue to drag it&amp;rsquo;s slow weight across the patient path&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is also not now, it&amp;rsquo;s been since the 1900s, over centuries, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to spread pessimism, criticize people around even if they are working for their vision/dream. They don&amp;rsquo;t even need one bad event for it; their prediction business is just on. If they get a bad event, oh my. One just need to realize this dead-simple thing: &amp;quot; &lt;strong>no-one knows about future&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everybody&amp;rsquo;s is guessing, some have seen similar thing before but still based on past experience they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>guessing&lt;/strong> nothing more. These are modern future predictors with some probability not even odds, so the important lesson is to trust our instincts and move across.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a good chance of failing here too, but at-least now understanding our own intuition is better than before and as everyone bet&amp;rsquo;s, mine bet was also on table.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leaving current org, risk and rewards</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/leaving-exising-org-risk-rewards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 09:34:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/leaving-exising-org-risk-rewards/</guid><description>&lt;p>Background:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been few things and also got new opportunities hence been planning to leave the existing org, meanwhile was having discussion my mentor(will ask him if I can put his name here) about my change and got really nice quote from him
While changing of jobs you need to think in terms of &lt;strong>risk and reward&lt;/strong>, and also one side quote &lt;code>the devil you know is better than one you don't.&lt;/code> (don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; mean literal &lt;code>devil&lt;/code> here but hope you understand meaning behind quote)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="risk">Risk:&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you join a new org, you are leaving something you know about(devil you know), how it functions and how to get things done there . When you move to a new org, you don&amp;rsquo;t know how it works, it&amp;rsquo;s a new cognitive load. Hence the risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reward">Reward:&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One reward that you see directly is compensation. It gets balanced with industry standards, not sure why it is so. Same person in the org is not compensated like a new employee coming in. It&amp;rsquo;s more like you don&amp;rsquo;t treat your current customer well and spend a lot of money on marketing to acquire new customers. There might be some reason probably a bit more google someday #todo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other important one is: sometimes if you&amp;rsquo;re really disgusted by the place you work in, a new workplace gives you a new fresh experience and meeting and working with new peers would be a great learning experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Git via Email Getting Started</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/git-via-email-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 03:01:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/git-via-email-getting-started/</guid><description>&lt;p>Simple way to that is via:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Q: &lt;strong>What is a &amp;ldquo;system call&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A: System calls are interface via which user-space program interact with system using linux kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So kernel is core that manages the system and talks and knows about hardware. Application don&amp;rsquo;t directly talk to hardware, they talk to kernel via some exposed interfaces(open, exec etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Q: &lt;strong>What is user-space and are there any other spaces&lt;/strong> ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A: Yes we have user-space and kernel-space&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kernel-space where only kernel is privileged to access memory or perform operation similarly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User-space where user is allowed to access memory or perform operation&lt;/li>

&lt;h4 id="steps-for-signing-certificate-by-ca">Steps for signing certificate by CA&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At this stage we have what we call the Pre-Certificate, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a finished certificate ready to issue but the only thing that&amp;rsquo;s missing is the CAs signature on the bottom of the certificate to make it official&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="signing-of-certificate">Signing of certificate&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>CA takes Pre-Certificate and running it through a hash function, currently SHA256, to obtain the digest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second step is the CA then taking that digest and encrypting it with their private key.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This encrypted digest is the signature and once appended to the end of the file we now have a signed certificate that can be issued to the Subscriber.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rules public key encryption&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>For every private key, there is only one corresponding public key.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with it&amp;rsquo;s corresponding private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it&amp;rsquo;s corresponding public key.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More rules and info at: &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Q: How does adding the &lt;strong>encrypted digest&lt;/strong> i.e. signature makes it signed certificate ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A: It can better be explained by putting browser in picture and looking at what it does while requesting https website.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4 id="what-browser-does">What browser does&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>During tls handshake with https endpoint, it fetches associate intermediate certificate and root certificate.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We need to upload intermediate certificate(public key of CA) and root certificate while uploading ssl certificate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Browser now decrypts the digest using intermediate certificates, if it is able to decrypt using intermediate key, it means that above certificate is signed by private-key of CA(data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it&amp;rsquo;s corresponding public key)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Browser itself also calculate hash of pre-certificate to compare with hash it got in step 2 after decrypting digest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If both are correct means,
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The signature definitely came from the CA. (Authenticity) - Step 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The certificate has not been tampered with. (Integrity) - Step 3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>DAC stands for Digital to Analog convertor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So music we store in USB or CD is stored in digital medium, and music is analog we hear, so we need some component to convert it to analog, and that&amp;rsquo;s DAC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of DAC available as he says, our laptops, our mobile which output sound has some DAC inbuilt into it, but there are some &amp;ldquo;high-end&amp;rdquo; where we can attached external DACs too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One advice he gives: Don&amp;rsquo;t by DAC which plays some some unicorn format or some high res it plays but more for the sound quality it outputs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moments: Breakfast With Champions</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/moments-breakfast-with-champions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 12:17:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/moments-breakfast-with-champions/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="hayden--httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcfksytfzy5m">Hayden: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfksYTFzY5M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfksYTFzY5M&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure there will be problems while doing work you like to do, those problems are worth solving and putting head into.

I was trying to understand how they all are related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three abrahamic religions&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Judaism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christanity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Islam&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Q: Who is Abrahim(Ibrahim in quran) ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Abraham (18th century BCE), tenth-generation descendant of Noah, of Hebrew lineage, was the son of Terah, uncle of Lot, father of Isaac, grandfather of Jacob, and forefather of the Israelites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jewish tradition states that he was the first to actively spread belief in One God&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Q: Who is Noah ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In Abrahamic religions, Noah[a] (/ˈnoʊ.ə/ NOH-ə)[1][2] was the tenth and last of the pre-Flood patriarchs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Genesis account, Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark at God&amp;rsquo;s command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Afterwards, God made a covenant(promised) with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth&amp;rsquo;s creatures with a flood.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Important point to note, and there are lot of stories, every major religion has their own version, so mine is one of many version I read up&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Q: Who is Jacob ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>According to legend, Jacob — also known as Israel — was Abraham’s grandson, and each of Jacob’s sons was the father of an Israelite tribe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One son, Joseph, went to Egypt(was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers), where he prospered in the face of adversity, and rose to become vizier, the second most powerful man in Egypt next to Pharaoh(probably king), and invited his brothers and his father to live in Egypt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A later pharaoh feared the Israelites on his land and so enslaved them, a condition in which they remained until Moses led them to freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Q: Who is moses( Tawrat in quran) ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the biblical narrative he was the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven, is traditionally attributed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When he was born the Pharaoh of Egypt had ordered to kill all new born Israelite(son of Isreal i.e. Jacob), but his mother hide him by putting him on basket in river Nile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He was caught by daughter of Pharaoh of Egypt or in quran(wife of Pharaoh), and he grew in Egypt royalty taken care by a hebrew care taker which in-turn was her mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Book of Exodus, he was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in population&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moses eventually frees Israelites from slavery, takes them to their promiseland.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He later gave the 10 commandments to Israelites.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Judaism:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people.
As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that Isaac, his second son, would inherit the Land of Israel (then called Canaan). Later, the descendants of Isaac&amp;rsquo;s son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt, and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt
Jacob is said to have had twelve sons by four women, his wives, Leah and Rachel, and his concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah, who were, in order of their birth, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin, all of whom became the heads of their own family groups, later known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Realised after reading a lot more about them, these 3 have their own history/lengend/mythology. It&amp;rsquo;s too much to go and deep dive in them, and each one of them has different story from one of them, whichever way I go, will be taking one story/legend/history for other which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense, so will let it go.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>One good night went in it, other night should not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Meanwhile I read more and added moses in it. Also&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rasul means messenger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hadith: Narratives of Prophet Muhaammad&amp;rsquo;s life, since in Quran it tells people to emulate Muhaamad life and Hadith is narratives of mohammad life, hence it get the value.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>First thing to know about IDs:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>IDs are unique&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Browser knows a bit about IDs, this ID is what we see in &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200428074032/https://blog.httpwatch.com/2011/03/01/6-things-you-should-know-about-fragment-urls/">fragment or hash-value&lt;/a>. Browser uses this to reach parts various part of repo. So it has to be unique.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For css it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it applies stying if you ask by &lt;code>#id_name&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.class_name&lt;/code> but browser wants ID to be unique.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it one style has to be used on multiple elements then use &lt;code>class&lt;/code> if yoou want to use it only once them go for &lt;code>id&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more you can read this post: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831165401/http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">https://web.archive.org/web/20140831165401/http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPv4 Link Local</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/ipv4-link-local/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 09:24:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/ipv4-link-local/</guid><description>&lt;p>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be
configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by
the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately,
such address configuration information may not always be available.
It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a
useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address
configuration is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It means link-local address are used when host is not able to get any network configuration from&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Manual Configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DHCP (DHCPv4 or DHCPv6)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>then it automatically take IP from pool of &lt;code>169.254.0.0/16 (169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255)&lt;/code>
mentioned in RFC &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927">3927&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Take any random IP from above pool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check if IP is not taken by others using broadcast via ARP&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If IP is taken then go back to step 1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If IP is not taken, then assign the IP to yourself and be ready for networking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Important points to be noted&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>These address are not routable by router
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why : Because it&amp;rsquo;s in RFC, our rulebook for internet and also rule makes sense too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In step2, we only check in our ARP domain i.e. layer 2, it makes sense not to get these routed by layer3, since there is bright chance other machines in their layer 2 would&amp;rsquo;ve done the same and IP would conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Reference:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RFC &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927">3927&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing
a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge
that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by&lt;br>
an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with &lt;br>
only these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hence, the &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; refers to the relationship between the way &lt;br>
things break and the sophistication available to repair them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

image (or any DOM element, really).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, if I have an image that is &lt;em>on its side&lt;/em>, I can use the following

transform&lt;/a>
to orient it correctly.&lt;/p>
