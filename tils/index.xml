  To create a patch: git format-patch &amp;lt;branch-you-want-to-send-patch-to&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;patches-folder&amp;gt;
A patch file is created, for me it was patches/0001-second.sh.patch, below is a sample patch.

      <description>Strace is really nice command to see what system calls are being used, it&amp;rsquo;s primary used as debugging tools for linux system calls
Q: What is a &amp;ldquo;system call&amp;rdquo; ?
A: System calls are interface via which user-space program interact with system using linux kernel.
So kernel is core that manages the system and talks and knows about hardware. Application don&amp;rsquo;t directly talk to hardware, they talk to kernel via some exposed interfaces(open, exec etc.</description>

      <title>Simplified view on How Certificate Signing works</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/how-certificate-signing-works/</link>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/how-certificate-signing-works/</guid>
      <description>Reference: https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/
Steps for signing certificate by CA  The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc. The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.</description>

      <title>Intro to DAC</title>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/intro-to-dac/</guid>
      <description>It all started from here and bit before, but this was final trigger for me to write: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhrv-O9sivI
DAC stands for Digital to Analog convertor.
So music we store in USB or CD is stored in digital medium, and music is analog we hear, so we need some component to convert it to analog, and that&amp;rsquo;s DAC.
There are lots of DAC available as he says, our laptops, our mobile which output sound has some DAC inbuilt into it, but there are some &amp;ldquo;high-end&amp;rdquo; where we can attached external DACs too.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t give up because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, if you love it: &amp;ldquo;do it&amp;rdquo;. It has to be done with joy, there is no point of adding more misery to our little world
Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.</description>

      <description>There is set of religions that come from Abrahim. I was trying to understand how they all are related.
There are three abrahamic religions

 Abraham (18th century BCE), tenth-generation descendant of Noah, of Hebrew lineage, was the son of Terah, uncle of Lot, father of Isaac, grandfather of Jacob, and forefather of the Israelites. Jewish tradition states that he was the first to actively spread belief in One God  Q: Who is Noah ?</description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/css-id-vs-class/</guid>
      <description>Simple CSS question while working on resume project, is when to use id and when to use class.
First thing to know about IDs:
 IDs are unique
 Browser knows a bit about IDs, this ID is what we see in fragment or hash-value. Browser uses this to reach parts various part of repo. So it has to be unique.
For css it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it applies stying if you ask by #id_name or .</description>

      <title>IPv4 Link Local</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/ipv4-link-local/</link>

      <description>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available.</description>

      <title>KISS</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tils/kiss/</link>

      <description>KISS is an acronym for &amp;ldquo;Keep it simple stupid&amp;rdquo; (notice no comma).
Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:
 The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools.</description>

      <title>Change Orientation of an Image</title>

      <description>A single-line CSS transform is all it takes to change the orientation of an image (or any DOM element, really).
For instance, if I have an image that is on its side, I can use the following rotate transform to orient it correctly.
1 2 3  img { transform: rotate(90deg); }   Testing you babay
1 2  import os os.path.join()    Go hello world
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.</description>
