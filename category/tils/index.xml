      <description>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available.</description>

      <description>KISS is an acronym for &amp;ldquo;Keep it simple stupid&amp;rdquo; (notice no comma).
Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:
 The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools.</description>

      <description>A single-line CSS transform is all it takes to change the orientation of an image (or any DOM element, really).
For instance, if I have an image that is on its side, I can use the following rotate transform to orient it correctly.
1 2 3  img { transform: rotate(90deg); }   Testing you babay
1 2  import os os.path.join()    Go hello world
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.</description>
