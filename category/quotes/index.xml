      <description>Have come to the conclusion that everyone sees a different movie in their head, even if they watch the same movie. It&amp;rsquo;s all in your state of your mind.
Used to think that what&amp;rsquo;s in head/thoughts matters but as grown up come to conclusion that no actions matters, what you do defines you not just what you think

      <description>Update note on previous quote, there has been time when I have lied to close once and was in illusion that doing it for greater good. Learnt it the hard way that every lie we say incurs debt to truth, and eventually it is paid.
Better it&amp;rsquo;s paid early, or you keep-on paying EMI in terms of stress and which in turn cause high blood pressure.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t let your future disturb you. You will meet if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against present
 If sometimes your future haunts you, for me personally someone close to me told a prophecy about me and it haunted me way longer than it should, hence was able to connect to it. IMO these things haunt the weak more than man of actions and yes reading does empower you against such weak thoughts.</description>

      <description>Never hate bad time. It reveals your true friends.
 Ref: https://twitter.com/pranavmahajan/status/1420387769252126728
Also one thing is learnt long back, and probably has become my nature. You can only have few friends with time you have.
 If you have more than three friends, probably you don&amp;rsquo;t have any.
 This is what my understanding as how now. Let see how it changes along with time.
Now while frequently update this site, thought came to my mind.</description>
