      <title>Video: A glimpse into ancient indian astronomy</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/video-a-glimpse-into-ancient-indian-astronomy/</link>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/video-a-glimpse-into-ancient-indian-astronomy/</guid>
      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>

      <title>Why Normalize CSS</title>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/why-normalize/</guid>
      <description>Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It‚Äôs a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
The aims of normalize.css are as follows:
 Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them. Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements. Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies. Improve usability with subtle improvements. Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.</description>

      <description>Some notes Writing is Thinking  &amp;ldquo;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are.&amp;rdquo; - The War of Art

      <description>Few notes Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your personal gratification, but you should never think it&amp;rsquo;s enough. If you lock yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work will be lost. You may as well not have bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known.</description>
