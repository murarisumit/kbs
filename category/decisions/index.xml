      <title>Moving From Human Friendly Urls to Ugly Uuid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human friendly url&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy for human to read(obivious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably better for search engines to get results(who know anyways, it would make sense having URL as params to search result imo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values have to fixed, not modification(important for me).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still structure are not fixed for me, so don&amp;rsquo;t want to tie myself with title or path or director.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-referencing become difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross referencing is important to me, and with keeping other param than UUID would be difficult to maintain, as it might break URL on this website(which is last thing I want), hence opting to machine generated &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/generating-a-unique-number-or-string/7930/6&#34;&gt;unique ID from hugo&lt;/a&gt; i.e. &lt;code&gt;{{ .File.UniqueID }}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally for me &lt;a href=&#34;https://kbs.murarisumit.in/tags/&#34;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; are preferred way to find similar topics, if anyone else other than me is looking at this website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Stopping Vim Now</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While learning more about tools for the trade, vim was the tool that was thrown at me a lot. This tool took a long time, because I went the wrong route and was trying to use it as IDE not how it was intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I started was at first, moved to config and plugin, instead of getting comfortable with vim-help, docs or core-vim without any setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt a few things here like vim-fugitive, it&amp;rsquo;s a great plugin, and alone it makes vim a treat to use. It makes my git usage very easy, staging and selecting hunks became easy for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works well for go and python and go still once in a while, but I still have to struggle with vim to get it work for me. I tend to spend time in my vim rather than working on problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became more evident to me when I was watching a youtube video on binary exploitation series &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&amp;index=7&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&amp;index=7&lt;/a&gt;, and came across this tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/radare/radare2&#34;&gt;https://github.com/radare/radare2&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed similar to vim, and I thought for beginners the tools should be secondary but playing with art is more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found similarities with learning badminton and drawing, focus on badminton as skill was more important. Focussed more on playing badminton, picked up any badminton racket and knew badminton racket wasn&amp;rsquo;t the bottleneck, my skills were. This was very evident to me, and was completely aware of that fact. People around me were buying head-heavy rackets, branded expensive rackets, for me 5min google and found a simple racket and just worked with that, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same went with the drawing course that I took on udemy, I just picked a simple pencil, rubber and eraser and started working on skill, instead of focusing on the tool. Instead of blue pencil and different type of pencils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a job, focussing on vim, is much trouble, it does things in an odd way, you need to learn it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably good for masters but for people like where bottleneck isn&amp;rsquo;t IDE but my skills focus should be on enhancing skills rather than tools for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools do matter to me, tmux is one fantastic tool which I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up and I love to core. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful tool to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will focus more on skills, like it worked for badminton and drawing will focus on creating products and instead of fighting with the system to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
