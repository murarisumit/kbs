      <description>After watch man of steel, which it was good. It would nice to see how krypton got destroyed and General Zod&amp;rsquo;s past.
Went on to see batman vs superman, at first I thought title was stupid. Batman vs superman makes no sense, but yeah it&amp;rsquo;s justifies after you watch movie, but some creativity here would have been nice, from someone whose company thrives on creativity.
I personally like spoilers, because would love to see story is being portrayed and only see portrayal if story is good.</description>
