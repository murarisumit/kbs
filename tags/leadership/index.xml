      <description>&lt;p&gt;Came to this blog from @navelism bot, which shared this &amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t decide, the answer is no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So big takeaways which made to space repitition were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;naval-ravikant-if-you-cant-decide-the-answer-is-no&#34;&gt;Naval Ravikant: If You Can&amp;rsquo;t Decide, The Answer Is No.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is, modern society is full of options. There are tons and tons of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people, and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. There are so many choices. You’re biologically not built to realize how many choices there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain. You’re never going to be absolutely certain, but you’re going to be very certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nassim-nicholas-taleb-you-only-need-one-reason-to-do-something&#34;&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb: You Only Need One Reason To Do Something.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one reason to do something… just don’t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was common theme Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger views on picking stocks. &lt;strong&gt;We only need one reason to reject, and choice should be obivious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leadership Lecture Sam Manekshaw</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He believes leaders are not born but made. You can make a leaders out of man with reasonable common-sense and decency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Most of part is taken from summarized transcript by fellow youtuber at video with little changes from my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to manekshaw sir qualities of leader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional competence&lt;/strong&gt; : He provided example of Defence Minister.  That minister had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it.&lt;/strong&gt; : 👉🏻 Act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong. 👉🏻 why a person don’t take decision?? because he lacks confidence!! why? because he lacks professional knowledge.  👉🏻 If you must be a &lt;strong&gt;bloody fool&lt;/strong&gt; be must quickly - manekshawism
Absolute justice and impartiality: People may not like you but you would be respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 moral courage: Ability to distinguish right from wrong. Then standby it, irrespective of what others think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 yes man, is a horrible man. He may rise very high, but will never become leader. He will be used by superior and disliked by colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 He mentioned story, when he was summoned. This was during east Pakistan crisis, by Indira Gandhi and cabinet ministers. Cabinet ministers in meeting  expected him to be agree to intervene in april month. This not prudent and he boldly put forward his dissent about choice of time rather than being yes-man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 physical courage: Everyone is scared, he tells he was scared too. To be a leader, one to have to physical courageous in face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentioned a story, where his subordinate threatened that he would kill him. That chap was big but he despite being scared, he made him santri for night. Also asked him to bring tea and hot water to him in morning. He had option to have more security around him, but he showed he has courage and also showing trust in his men. Funnily he goes on to say, don’t be fool-hardy like he was but we need to understand the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt; : Its two way thing, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he is also loyal to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of men and sources: He mostly conveyed about role of emotional intelligence. Human have problems so being stern should be combined with human touch and sense of humour play a great role in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discipline and Character&lt;/strong&gt; No amount leadership would put things right, the two other important aspect(that we usually lack)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 Discipline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline is code of conduct for decent living in society one with the other. This code of conduct has come from generation to generation, it’s come from holy books. It gets refined on as cultures change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Non-punctuality is an act of ill-discipline. Very harmful for society and nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 Character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be honest, truthful etc. The big picture is, knowing what you are. Do not let fans or hangers-on put you on pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do watch the video, if you have time. You can learn lessons on how to communicates. Sweet little jokes he cracks, makes it far insightful than above mentioned transcript&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Jordan Peterson Successful Men Are Insane and Work All the Time</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/ce39966c39f2ea7d1a55946669a84685/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He said in one of his interviews that men wrote to him and told that he changed his life. I&amp;rsquo;m one of such characters. Here also a lot of thanks goes to people who made the internet happen, so I could watch his lessons/lectures or speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve to be highly successful in corporate world i.e. reach at high position in social order one has to put insane amount of work, he mentioned 80 hours work week, translates to ~ 12 hours every day without breaks for years and with &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;determination&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~hello~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t like when kids go to work to the library to study for 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High social order always means different from different cultures. India had a weird culture once, people who left the material world and lived for pursuit of knowledge were treated on high pecking order, but that is for a very evolved state of culture. Mostly it would refer to high financial or political position.
Disclaimer: Today India is in a very sad state w.r.t its culture and the same system has become the biggest baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Will Mahatma Gandhi be treated in a higher social order than Bill Gates or Sir Albert Einstein ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One needs to make decision,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either earn good enough money to enjoy life and then learn music, take care of body, tap-dancing, beautiful literature, learning physics, getting close to oneself/god&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be insane and work like crazy and get up in pecking order&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or third he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention having a middle ground, keep working your whole life because you enjoy it and reach in high pecking order. While taking care of your body, mind, being calm and happy all along in life. Is this route possible ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8&#34;&gt;Happiness Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; had a very huge impact on me, during my college years, but is this route possible? &lt;strong&gt;This would good exploration in my life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    So goal of life is to explore this third route&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
