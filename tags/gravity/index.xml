It gets acceleration towards the earth as if earth is pulling it towards itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This &lt;a href="https://kbs.murarisumit.in/en/c6e8cea33966964777e8ec8b34a71cef">acceleration&lt;/a> is 9.8 m/s^2 on earth, 1.6 m/s^2 on the moon, 3.7 m/s^2 on Mars etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This acceleration is 0 m/s^2 in space.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>So, if we throw some object in space, it will keep moving in the same direction. It will not come back to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="newtons-theory-of-gravity">Newton&amp;rsquo;s theory of gravity&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Newton had his theory why we feel this acceleration. He said that mass attracts mass.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Hence earth attracts us. So, we feel a force that pulls us towards the earth. This force is called gravity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="einsteins-theory-of-gravity">Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of gravity&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Einstein had his theory on how this force comes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He said that mass bends the &lt;a href="https://kbs.murarisumit.in/en/f7de1f85aff4e3440204f197756f8b68/">space-time&lt;/a> around it. So, objects are pulled towards the mass. This bending of space-time is called gravity.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>So here even the particle with no mass is pulled towards the mass. Because mass bends the space-time around it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever the theory of origin of this force, we found that earth &amp;amp; other planets pull objects towards themselves which causes acceleration. This acceleration is called gravity.&lt;/li>
