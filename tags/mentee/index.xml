      <description>Background:
There have been few things and also got new opportunities hence been planning to leave the existing org, meanwhile was having discussion my mentor(will ask him if I can put his name here) about my change and got really nice quote from him While changing of jobs you need to think in terms of risk and reward, and also one side quote the devil you know is better than one you don&#39;t.</description>
