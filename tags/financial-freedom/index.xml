Can relate to him, seems like a neighbourhood elder brother(bhaiya) who you can talk to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What he mentioned was, spend on skills. More like one message in a 3-idiot movie. Run after excellence, success will come to you. He isn&amp;rsquo;t sadhu and adds on to say to buy material assets like cars or houses. If a house gives peace of mind, improves quality of life, go buy a house. If cars make your life easy, use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important thing he mentioned is, we have to make money work for us to be financially independent and financial freedom is about being content. There are endless materialistic traps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to few more bits to the post. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvBZjKXVyP8&amp;t=399s">There are three important assets&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We need to optimise on these three bits.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
