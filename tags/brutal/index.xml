Created railroads, port, and other infra in Central American countries for plundering them. Owning the entire supply chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy to draw comparison to what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company&lt;/a> did in India but on the smaller scale. Not killing millions of people, but still very brutal for any human being. I see them and see Hitler and can&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still can see how people think United fruit company and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company&lt;/a> were the force of good. They did good for those countries they were plundering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This video also shows the side where we see how US imperialism works. How they destabilize the country. Quite an eye-opener for someone who grew up to see the USA as a sort-of force of good and democracy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
