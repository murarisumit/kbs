      <description>&lt;p&gt;Update note on previous quote, there has been time when I have lied to close once and was in illusion that doing it for greater good. Learnt it the hard way that every lie we say incurs debt to truth, and eventually it is paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better it&amp;rsquo;s paid early, or you keep-on paying EMI in terms of stress and which in turn cause high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
