      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company&#34;&gt;United fruit company&lt;/a&gt;. Created railroads, port, and other infra in Central American countries for plundering them. Owning the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to draw comparison to what &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt; did in India but on the smaller scale. Not killing millions of people, but still very brutal for any human being. I see them and see Hitler and can&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still can see how people think United fruit company and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt;  were the force of good. They did good for those countries they were plundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video also shows the side where we see how US imperialism works. How they destabilize the country. Quite an eye-opener for someone who grew up to see the USA as a sort-of force of good and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
