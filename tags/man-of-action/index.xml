      <description>Have come to the conclusion that everyone sees a different movie in their head, even if they watch the same movie. It&amp;rsquo;s all in your state of your mind.
Used to think that what&amp;rsquo;s in head/thoughts matters but as grown up come to conclusion that no actions matters, what you do defines you not just what you think

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t let your future disturb you. You will meet if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against present
 If sometimes your future haunts you, for me personally someone close to me told a prophecy about me and it haunted me way longer than it should, hence was able to connect to it. IMO these things haunt the weak more than man of actions and yes reading does empower you against such weak thoughts.</description>
