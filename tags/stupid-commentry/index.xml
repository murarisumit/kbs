      <description>After watch man of steel, which was good. It would nice to see how krypton got destroyed and General Zod&amp;rsquo;s past.
Went on to see batman vs superman, at first I thought title was stupid. Batman vs superman makes no sense, but yeah it&amp;rsquo;s justifies after you watch movie, but some creativity here would have been nice, from someone whose company thrives on creativity.
I personally like spoilers, because would love to see story is being portrayed and only see portrayal if story is good.</description>

      <description>You get up every morning.
You show up.
You do the right things.
You work really really hard.
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.
  Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.
 tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.</description>
