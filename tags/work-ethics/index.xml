      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t give up because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, if you love it: &amp;ldquo;do it&amp;rdquo;. It has to be done with joy, there is no point of adding more misery to our little world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure there will be problems while doing work you like to do, those problems are worth solving and putting head into. It might be because what you want other people also want, which takes away the thing you want and like. There you need to show your determination, survival skills but use them for the job you like to do.&lt;/p&gt;
