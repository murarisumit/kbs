      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The /bin directory contains commands which may be used by both the system
administrator and by users, but which are required when no other filesystems
are mounted (e.g. in single user mode). It may also contain commands which are
used indirectly by scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The /sbin directory contains commands which are usually only needed by the
system administrator, for system maintenance.  System administration programs
that are required for system repair, system recovery, mounting /usr, or other
essential functions must be placed in /sbin instead of /bin.  It may also
contain commands which are indirectly used by scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
