      <description>Remember: voltage is the energy required to make current. If you say current kills but not voltage, its like saying bullet kills not the gun that triggers it.
One good comment: High Voltage + Microamps Current = Tesla Coil and Van De Graaff Generator. High Current + Very Low Voltage = Welding Machine. High Voltage + High Current = Killer. Electric Power Lines and Lightning.
What one needs to understood: When a high current is passed through your body, you die, but to achieve this current, you have to have a high voltage.</description>
