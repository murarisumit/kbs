&lt;p>Never hate bad time. It reveals your true friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ref: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pranavmahajan/status/1420387769252126728">https://twitter.com/pranavmahajan/status/1420387769252126728&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also one thing is learnt long back, and probably has become my nature. You can only have few friends with time you have.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you have more than three friends, probably you don&amp;rsquo;t have any.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is what my understanding as how now. Let see how it changes along with time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now while frequently update this site, thought came to my mind. How often would I come and read this and reason for putting thsese in public. Probably if can keep this site running for 5, 10 or 20 years, would love to see how time has changed and how thought process has changed(including learning to use spellcheck in future ;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
