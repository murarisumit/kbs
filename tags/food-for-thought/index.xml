      <description>You get up every morning.
You show up.
You do the right things.
You work really really hard.
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.
  Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.
 tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.</description>

      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>
