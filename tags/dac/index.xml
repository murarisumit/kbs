&lt;p>DAC stands for Digital to Analog convertor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So music we store in USB or CD is stored in digital medium, and music is analog we hear, so we need some component to convert it to analog, and that&amp;rsquo;s DAC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of DAC available as he says, our laptops, our mobile which output sound has some DAC inbuilt into it, but there are some &amp;ldquo;high-end&amp;rdquo; where we can attached external DACs too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One advice he gives: Don&amp;rsquo;t by DAC which plays some some unicorn format or some high res it plays but more for the sound quality it outputs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
