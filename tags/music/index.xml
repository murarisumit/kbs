      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was listening to thismusic in college, today there was discussion and flamenco again came up. It was sweet memory lane to go and also happy to see this video is still there in youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How intrusive youtube-ads are, but is does provide value of society. Not sure if we have any way to store music forever like we have books for text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intro to DAC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started from here and bit before, but this was final trigger for me to write: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhrv-O9sivI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhrv-O9sivI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAC stands for Digital to Analog convertor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So music we store in USB or CD is stored in digital medium, and music is analog we hear, so we need some component to convert it to analog, and that&amp;rsquo;s DAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of DAC available as he says, our laptops, our mobile which output sound has some DAC inbuilt into it, but there are some &amp;ldquo;high-end&amp;rdquo; where we can attached external DACs too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One advice he gives: Don&amp;rsquo;t by DAC which plays some some unicorn format or some high res it plays but more for the sound quality it outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
