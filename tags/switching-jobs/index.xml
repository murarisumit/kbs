&lt;p>There have been few things and also got new opportunities hence been planning to leave the existing org, meanwhile was having discussion my mentor(will ask him if I can put his name here) about my change and got really nice quote from him
While changing of jobs you need to think in terms of &lt;strong>risk and reward&lt;/strong>, and also one side quote &lt;code>the devil you know is better than one you don't.&lt;/code> (don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; mean literal &lt;code>devil&lt;/code> here but hope you understand meaning behind quote)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="risk">Risk:&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you join a new org, you are leaving something you know about(devil you know), how it functions and how to get things done there . When you move to a new org, you don&amp;rsquo;t know how it works, it&amp;rsquo;s a new cognitive load. Hence the risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reward">Reward:&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One reward that you see directly is compensation. It gets balanced with industry standards, not sure why it is so. Same person in the org is not compensated like a new employee coming in. It&amp;rsquo;s more like you don&amp;rsquo;t treat your current customer well and spend a lot of money on marketing to acquire new customers. There might be some reason probably a bit more google someday #todo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other important one is: sometimes if you&amp;rsquo;re really disgusted by the place you work in, a new workplace gives you a new fresh experience and meeting and working with new peers would be a great learning experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
