It&amp;rsquo;s all in your state of your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Used to think that what&amp;rsquo;s in head/thoughts matters but as grown up come to conclusion that &lt;strong>no actions matters&lt;/strong>, what you do defines you &lt;strong>not just what you think&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

This scene might have given goose bumps to Roger Federer too, you may fall but it&amp;rsquo;s what you choose afterwards that matters the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the dialogue from rocky comes to my mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It ain&amp;rsquo;t about how hard you hit; It&amp;rsquo;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>American nationalism had brought beautiful movies out there and something to learn from. Deserters/Refugees coming from every parts of world and joining together and making a &lt;strong>great&lt;/strong> nation. Nation making is huge task, India still isn&amp;rsquo;t a nation yet despite such commonality, history and culture, but American built nation from deserters, some refugees true but most deserters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Always in awe to see to see American might and what they have achieved. They really are a nation to look upto.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
