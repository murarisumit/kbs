      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t give up because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, if you love it: &amp;ldquo;do it&amp;rdquo;. It has to be done with joy, there is no point of adding more misery to our little world
Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.</description>
