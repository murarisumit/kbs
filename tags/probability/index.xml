      <description>All medical tests do is update their probability of having disease, and not telling if we have disease or not.
There are three things
 Prevalence : How commen is that disease around here. What chance of having it without tests. Senstivity : If even disease is present, how good is test at detecting it. Specificity : If test taken, there can be other issues that result. Clot in pancrease, can be because of lot many things.</description>
