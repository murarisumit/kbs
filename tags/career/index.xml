      <description>Time to time, few profiles come across to me, which I see and admire of, the amount of work they have done. The position they are in, the impact they are making. Seeing their profiles motivates me.
These profile answer age old interview question for me: Where do you see youself in 3-5 years ?
His readme is beautiful, simple and succint. His github is clean. Motivated me also collect those badges(certifications), never a certification guy, but those badges are looking cool.</description>
