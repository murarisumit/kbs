      <description>This guy is simple to understand, no out of the world quotations. Can relate to him, seems like a neighbourhood elder brother(bhaiya) who you can talk to.
What he mentioned was, spend on skills. More like one message in a 3-idiot movie. Run after excellence, success will come to you. He isn&amp;rsquo;t sadhu and adds on to say to buy material assets like cars or houses. If a house gives peace of mind, improves quality of life, go buy a house.</description>
