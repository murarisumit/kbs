      <description>You get up every morning.
You show up.
You do the right things.
You work really really hard.
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.
  Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.
 tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.</description>

      <title>Why Stopping Vim Now</title>

      <description>While learning more about tools for the trade, vim was the tool that was thrown at me a lot. This tool took a long time, because I went the wrong route and was trying to use it as IDE not how it was intended.
The way I started was at first, moved to config and plugin, instead of getting comfortable with vim-help, docs or core-vim without any setting.
I learnt a few things here like vim-fugitive, it&amp;rsquo;s a great plugin, and alone it makes vim a treat to use.</description>

      <description>Some notes Writing is Thinking  &amp;ldquo;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are.&amp;rdquo; - The War of Art
  &amp;ldquo;Each time you write a page, you are a writer.</description>

      <title>Sell Yourself, Sell Your Work</title>

      <description>Few notes Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your personal gratification, but you should never think it&amp;rsquo;s enough. If you lock yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work will be lost. You may as well not have bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known.</description>
