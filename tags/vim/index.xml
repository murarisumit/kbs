This tool took a long time, because I went the wrong route and was trying to use it as IDE not how it was intended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way I started was at first, moved to config and plugin, instead of getting comfortable with vim-help, docs or core-vim without any setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learnt a few things here like vim-fugitive, it&amp;rsquo;s a great plugin, and alone it makes vim a treat to use. It makes my git usage very easy, staging and selecting hunks became easy for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works well for go and python and go still once in a while, but I still have to struggle with vim to get it work for me. I tend to spend time in my vim rather than working on problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It became more evident to me when I was watching a youtube video on binary exploitation series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&amp;index=7">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&amp;index=7&lt;/a>, and came across this tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2">https://github.com/radare/radare2&lt;/a>. It seemed similar to vim, and I thought for beginners the tools should be secondary but playing with art is more important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found similarities with learning badminton and drawing, focus on badminton as skill was more important. Focussed more on playing badminton, picked up any badminton racket and knew badminton racket wasn&amp;rsquo;t the bottleneck, my skills were. This was very evident to me, and was completely aware of that fact. People around me were buying head-heavy rackets, branded expensive rackets, for me 5min google and found a simple racket and just worked with that, nothing more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same went with the drawing course that I took on udemy, I just picked a simple pencil, rubber and eraser and started working on skill, instead of focusing on the tool. Instead of blue pencil and different type of pencils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But for a job, focussing on vim, is much trouble, it does things in an odd way, you need to learn it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably good for masters but for people like where bottleneck isn&amp;rsquo;t IDE but my skills focus should be on enhancing skills rather than tools for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tools do matter to me, tmux is one fantastic tool which I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up and I love to core. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful tool to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I will focus more on skills, like it worked for badminton and drawing will focus on creating products and instead of fighting with the system to get things done.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
