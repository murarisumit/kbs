      <description>This video actually helps us understand how electricity is generated by using magnets.
When studies electricity for first time, never understood where does frequency mean, what current is, what does voltage mean and simple things like this and whole electrical energy didn&amp;rsquo;t made sense to me. Formula application and somehow got through grades still Now most of it does, probably if I go for advanced study would really sense make.</description>
