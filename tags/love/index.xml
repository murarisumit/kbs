&lt;p>External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I good line that i need to keep in check is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo;
His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One thing that i read long back was:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you want someone to be open to you, go ask for some favour, once people have done favor they are more open to talk to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not sure if above is good advice, never understood it properly, so please try at your own risk, but that goes by the same theory mentioned in first quote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not in alignment with his ideas, sounds good though. Got similar thoughts with brahma kumaris(&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8)&lt;/a>, still not in agreement with it. Love if feeling(people say), which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand and not sure what this work exactly mean. Care I understand, responsibility I comprehend, but not sure of Love.&lt;/p>
