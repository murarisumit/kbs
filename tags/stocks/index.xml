&lt;h4 id="shares-">Shares :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Certificates or book entries representing ownership in a corporation or similar entity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="parface-value-">Par/Face Value :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Usually important for debt/bonds, because interest is calculated on based of this face value
Decided when releasing the stocks
Par value is usually very low in stocks, because company doesn’t want to have liability if stock prices go down below the par value
It has no connection to the market value of the share of stock&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="outstanding-stocks-">Outstanding stocks :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Stocks held by shareholders
Publicly traded companies are obligated to report the number of issued and outstanding shares,&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="treasury-stock-">Treasury stock :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Treasury stock (treasury shares) are the portion of shares that a company keeps in its own treasury
Treasury stock may have come from a repurchase or buyback from shareholders, or it may have never been issued to the public in the first place
Treasury stock is not considered when calculating dividends or earnings per share.
These are kept in the company’s treasury to be used to create extra cash if it is needed. Another reason may be to keep a controlling interest within the treasury to help ward off hostile takeovers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="share-capital-">Share capital :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It consists of all funds raised by a company in exchange for shares of their stocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="outstanding-share-capital-">Outstanding share capital :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Share capital less the par value of shares that are held as the company’s treasury stock.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="earnings-per-shareeps-">Earnings per share(EPS) :&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A company’s profit divided by its number of common outstanding shares. If a company earning ₹200 in one year had 200 common shares of stock outstanding, its EPS would be ₹1 per share.
The one-year (historical or trailing) EPS growth rate is calculated as the percentage change in earnings per share(EPS).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So big takeaways which made to space repitition were&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="naval-ravikant-if-you-cant-decide-the-answer-is-no">Naval Ravikant: If You Can&amp;rsquo;t Decide, The Answer Is No.&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is, modern society is full of options. There are tons and tons of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people, and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. There are so many choices. You’re biologically not built to realize how many choices there are.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain. You’re never going to be absolutely certain, but you’re going to be very certain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="nassim-nicholas-taleb-you-only-need-one-reason-to-do-something">Nassim Nicholas Taleb: You Only Need One Reason To Do Something.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you have more than one reason to do something… just don’t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This was common theme Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger views on picking stocks. &lt;strong>We only need one reason to reject, and choice should be obivious.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stock Market Investing Strategy</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/aa68a2a28a8178304a35c8339a99d5f2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 07:12:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/aa68a2a28a8178304a35c8339a99d5f2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the stock market, the most important organ is the stomach. It&amp;rsquo;s not the brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="understand-what-you-own">Understand what you own.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No use of checking everyday or getting stock calls. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Understand what you invest in. You need to check quarterly reports, see if finances are in place. So when it falls, you can gauge if it&amp;rsquo;s moment of panic or buying opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="understand-market">Understand market.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Understand the bear market is going to come, correction is always there. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s inevitable&lt;/strong>. He tells at time of video during 93 years of market, there was 10% falling(correction) 50 times. There was 25% falling(Bear market) of market almost ~6 years. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets">List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets&lt;/a>
If you understand what you own, then you will have stomach for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="when-to-sell-the-stock">When to sell the stock&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you understand what you own, it becomes easier. If you still see room for growth continue, even if 5x, 10x stock has grown. When you don&amp;rsquo;t see the growth, because you know it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="criteria-for-investing">Criteria for investing&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose less-debt companies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t invest with 1- 2 years in horizon. Have outlook of 10, 20 or 30 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="side-information">Side information&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t need many multi-bagger, only few for making lot of money.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t fall for how bad it can go. It can go fruther low and to the point of crash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t keep stocks like family, treat them like utility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stock goes up, I must right. Stock goes down, it must be wrong. &lt;strong>This is wrong mindset&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
