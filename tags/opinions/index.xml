      <description>More my understanding of the world grows by reading various prophecies people have made before, makes me realize that there is no point in taking hearsay seriously, be it from news channels, be it anywhere else. No one knows the future, it&amp;rsquo;s so obvious, still people are into prediction/criticism business and it&amp;rsquo;s working well too.

      <description>After watch man of steel, which was good. It would nice to see how krypton got destroyed and General Zod&amp;rsquo;s past.
Went on to see batman vs superman, at first I thought title was stupid. Batman vs superman makes no sense, but yeah it&amp;rsquo;s justifies after you watch movie, but some creativity here would have been nice, from someone whose company thrives on creativity.
I personally like spoilers, because would love to see story is being portrayed and only see portrayal if story is good.</description>
