      <description>Somehow reached to this tacky/clickbaity title &amp;ldquo;How the smartphone is destroying you from inside&amp;rdquo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjC245ugW8. Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.
So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.</description>

      <description>It was good to see nice laptops coming in now. Which have this repairability in mind. This laptop specially looks with it&amp;rsquo;s modularity. As iFixit says, this is slippery slope, we have seen many such initiatives come and go. So hoping this works time and changes consumer electronics industry for good.
Kudos to https://frame.work/ team.</description>

      <description>Main highlights as mentioned by top commentator
  Scan containers and Pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  Run containers and Pods with the least privileges possible.
  Use network separation to control the amount of damage a compromise can cause.
  Use firewalls to limit unneeded network connectivity and encryption to protect confidentiality.
  Use strong authentication and authorization to limit user and administrator access as well as to limit the attack surface.</description>

      <description>Filtering with allocating This trick uses the fact that a slice shares the same backing array and capacity as the original, so the storage is reused for the filtered slice. Of course, the original contents are modified.
1 2 3 4 5 6  b := a[:0] for _, x := range a { if f(x) { b = append(b, x) } }   </description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>This youtube video(click the title, that is how bookmarks are arranged for all posts), is of Abraham Joshua Heshel Twerski, an Israeli-American Hasidic rabbi, a scion of the Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty, and a psychiatrist specializing in substance abuse.
External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>

      <description>After watch man of steel, which was good. It would nice to see how krypton got destroyed and General Zod&amp;rsquo;s past.
Went on to see batman vs superman, at first I thought title was stupid. Batman vs superman makes no sense, but yeah it&amp;rsquo;s justifies after you watch movie, but some creativity here would have been nice, from someone whose company thrives on creativity.
I personally like spoilers, because would love to see story is being portrayed and only see portrayal if story is good.</description>

      <description>Never hate bad time. It reveals your true friends.
 Ref: https://twitter.com/pranavmahajan/status/1420387769252126728
Also one thing is learnt long back, and probably has become my nature. You can only have few friends with time you have.
 If you have more than three friends, probably you don&amp;rsquo;t have any.
 This is what my understanding as how now. Let see how it changes along with time.
Now while frequently update this site, thought came to my mind.</description>

How intrusive youtube-ads are, but is does provide value of society. Not sure if we have any way to store music forever like we have books for text.</description>

      <description>You get up every morning.
You show up.
You do the right things.
You work really really hard.
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.
  Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.
 tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.</description>

Q: What is a &amp;ldquo;system call&amp;rdquo; ?
A: System calls are interface via which user-space program interact with system using linux kernel.
So kernel is core that manages the system and talks and knows about hardware. Application don&amp;rsquo;t directly talk to hardware, they talk to kernel via some exposed interfaces(open, exec etc.</description>

      <description>Reference: https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/
Steps for signing certificate by CA  The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc. The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.</description>

      <description>It all started from here and bit before, but this was final trigger for me to write: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhrv-O9sivI
DAC stands for Digital to Analog convertor.
So music we store in USB or CD is stored in digital medium, and music is analog we hear, so we need some component to convert it to analog, and that&amp;rsquo;s DAC.
There are lots of DAC available as he says, our laptops, our mobile which output sound has some DAC inbuilt into it, but there are some &amp;ldquo;high-end&amp;rdquo; where we can attached external DACs too.</description>

      <description>Found this beautiful kickstarter at: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terraplanter/terra-planter-the-inside-out-hydroponic-planter-pot . Youtube video for the same is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GruSnziMV4U
Nice simple alternative to that which can be reasonably found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Jv9b94WOg
A nice vertical green tower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWviyAuh-aE
 I think i can make more improvement on it, like ability to add manure at any level of tower, also clay design would help as pockets can directly absorb from it.  </description>

      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t give up because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, if you love it: &amp;ldquo;do it&amp;rdquo;. It has to be done with joy, there is no point of adding more misery to our little world
Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.</description>

      <description>There is set of religions that come from Abrahim. I was trying to understand how they all are related.
There are three abrahamic religions
 Judaism Christanity Islam  Q: Who is Abrahim(Ibrahim in quran) ?
 Abraham (18th century BCE), tenth-generation descendant of Noah, of Hebrew lineage, was the son of Terah, uncle of Lot, father of Isaac, grandfather of Jacob, and forefather of the Israelites. Jewish tradition states that he was the first to actively spread belief in One God  Q: Who is Noah ?</description>

      <description>Simple CSS question while working on resume project, is when to use id and when to use class.
First thing to know about IDs:
 IDs are unique
 Browser knows a bit about IDs, this ID is what we see in fragment or hash-value. Browser uses this to reach parts various part of repo. So it has to be unique.
For css it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it applies stying if you ask by #id_name or .</description>

      <description>While learning more about tools for the trade, vim was the tool that was thrown at me a lot. This tool took a long time, because I went the wrong route and was trying to use it as IDE not how it was intended.
The way I started was at first, moved to config and plugin, instead of getting comfortable with vim-help, docs or core-vim without any setting.
I learnt a few things here like vim-fugitive, it&amp;rsquo;s a great plugin, and alone it makes vim a treat to use.</description>

      <description>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available.</description>

      <description>Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It’s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
The aims of normalize.css are as follows:
 Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them. Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements. Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies. Improve usability with subtle improvements. Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.</description>

      <description>Some notes Writing is Thinking  &amp;ldquo;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are.&amp;rdquo; - The War of Art

      <title>KISS</title>

      <description>KISS is an acronym for &amp;ldquo;Keep it simple stupid&amp;rdquo; (notice no comma).
Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:
 The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools.</description>

      <description>Few notes Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your personal gratification, but you should never think it&amp;rsquo;s enough. If you lock yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work will be lost. You may as well not have bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known.</description>

      <description>A single-line CSS transform is all it takes to change the orientation of an image (or any DOM element, really).
For instance, if I have an image that is on its side, I can use the following rotate transform to orient it correctly.
1 2 3  img { transform: rotate(90deg); }   Testing you babay
1 2  import os os.path.join()    Go hello world
