He provided example of Defence Minister who had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it</strong> :
👉🏻 act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong.
👉🏻 why a person don&rsquo;t take decision?? because he lacks confidence!! why?  because he lacks professional knowledge !
👉🏻 if you must be a bloody fool be must quickly - manekshawism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>absolute justice and impartiality</strong>
By this way you may not be liked by all but be respected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>courage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>👉🏻 moral courage:  ability to distinguish right from wrong and standby it irrespective of what others think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👉🏻 yes man, is horrible man, he may rise very high, but will never become leader, he will be used by superior and disliked by colleagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👉🏻(he mentioned story, when he was summoned, during east Pakistan crisis, by Indira Gandhi and other cabinet minister who expected him to be agree to intervene in april month, which was not prudent and he boldly put forward his dissent about choice of time rather than being yesman )</p>
</li>

<p>👉🏻 physical courage:
Everyone is scared, he tells he was scared too. To be a leader, one to have to physical courageous in face of adversity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He mentioned a story, where his subordinate threatened that he would kill him, that chap was big but he despite being scared. He made him santri for night and asked him to bring tea and hot water to him in morning. He had option to have more security around him, but he showed he has courage and also showing trust in his men. Funnily he goes on to say, don&rsquo;t be fool-hardy like he was but we need to understand the idea.</p>
<ol start="5">

<p><strong>loyalty</strong>
Its two way thing, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he is also loyal to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>management of men and sources</strong>

This code of conduct has come from generation to generation, it&rsquo;s come from holy books and refined on as cultures change</p>
</blockquote>
