      <description>3D printing is in nascent stages India, but seeing rocket being made out of this tech is so motivating and makes you look in future about possibility and how would it look like. Also thoughts come to mind, that why aren&amp;rsquo;t thing like electric 2-wheelers, drones, houses in India are using it, but then answer comes even more quickly, that people like are in jobs instead of innovating out there, so how would the change happen.</description>

      <title>Linux Load Avgs</title>

      <description>Excerpt from blog post Linux load averages are &amp;ldquo;system load averages&amp;rdquo; that show the running thread (task) demand on the system as an average number of running plus waiting threads. This measures demand, which can be greater than what the system is currently processing. Most tools show three averages, for 1, 5, and 15 minutes:
Some interpretations:
 If the averages are 0.0, then your system is idle. If the 1 minute average is higher than the 5 or 15 minute averages, then load is increasing.</description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/understand-electricity-generation/</guid>
      <description>This video actually helps us understand how electricity is generated by using magnets.
When studies electricity for first time, never understood where does frequency mean, what current is, what does voltage mean and simple things like this and whole electrical energy didn&amp;rsquo;t made sense to me. Now most of it does, probably if I go for advanced study would really make sense.</description>

Not a fan of twitter, but using twitter to reach out to people get feedback, improve ourselves, make myself better and this note is to remind myself why enabled this feature of social sharing in this site.</description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/bayes-rule-medical-tests/</guid>
      <description>All medical tests do is update their probability of having disease, and not tell if we have disease or not.
There are three things
 Prevalence : How common is that disease around here? What chance of having it without tests? Sensitivity : If even disease is present, how good is the test at detecting it. Specificity : If a test is taken, there can be other issues that result. Clots in the pancreas can be because of a lot many things.</description>

      <description>Somehow reached to this tacky/clickbaity title &amp;ldquo;How the smartphone is destroying you from inside&amp;rdquo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjC245ugW8. Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.
So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.</description>

      <description>It was good to see nice laptops coming in now. Which have this repairability in mind. This laptop specially looks with it&amp;rsquo;s modularity. As iFixit says, this is slippery slope, we have seen many such initiatives come and go. So hoping this company works and changes consumer electronics industry for good.
Kudos to https://frame.work/ team.</description>

      <description>Main highlights as mentioned by top commentator
  Scan containers and Pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  Run containers and Pods with the least privileges possible.
  Use network separation to control the amount of damage a compromise can cause.
  Use firewalls to limit unneeded network connectivity and encryption to protect confidentiality.
  Use strong authentication and authorization to limit user and administrator access as well as to limit the attack surface.</description>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/golang-slice-tricks/</guid>
      <description>Filtering with allocating This trick uses the fact that a slice shares the same backing array and capacity as the original, so the storage is reused for the filtered slice. Of course, the original contents are modified.

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>This youtube video(click the title, that is how bookmarks are arranged for all posts), is of Abraham Joshua Heshel Twerski, an Israeli-American Hasidic rabbi, a scion of the Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty, and a psychiatrist specializing in substance abuse.
External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>

      <description>You get up every morning.
You show up.
You do the right things.
You work really really hard.
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.
  Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.
 tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.</description>

      <title>Video: A glimpse into ancient indian astronomy</title>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/video-a-glimpse-into-ancient-indian-astronomy/</guid>
      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>

      <title>Why Normalize CSS</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/why-normalize/</link>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/why-normalize/</guid>
      <description>Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It’s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
The aims of normalize.css are as follows:
 Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them. Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements. Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies. Improve usability with subtle improvements. Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.</description>

      <description>Some notes Writing is Thinking  &amp;ldquo;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are.&amp;rdquo; - The War of Art
  &amp;ldquo;Each time you write a page, you are a writer.</description>

      <description>Few notes Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your personal gratification, but you should never think it&amp;rsquo;s enough. If you lock yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work will be lost. You may as well not have bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known.</description>
