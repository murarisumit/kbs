      <title>How I Use Tmux</title>

      <description>For MacOS, I chose iTerm2 because it’s able to send a series of hex codes to the terminal via a keybind. Again, if I am using tmux through ssh, I can still use the keybindings, as if tmux were running locally.
Setting up the keybinds is not the most straightforward process. In the iTerm2 Settings &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Keys, I added new keybindings with the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; button. And in the dialog dropdown, I chose &amp;ldquo;Send Hex Code.</description>

      <title>What Is Not Love</title>

      <guid>https://www.yinyangi.in/kbs/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>

      <title>Why Normalize CSS</title>
      <link>https://www.yinyangi.in/kbs/bookmarks/why-normalize/</link>

      <guid>https://www.yinyangi.in/kbs/bookmarks/why-normalize/</guid>
      <description>Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It’s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
The aims of normalize.css are as follows:
 Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them. Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements. Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies. Improve usability with subtle improvements. Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.</description>

      <description>Some notes Writing is Thinking  &amp;ldquo;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are.&amp;rdquo; - The War of Art
  &amp;ldquo;Each time you write a page, you are a writer.</description>

      <title>Sell Yourself, Sell Your Work</title>

      <description>Few notes Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your personal gratification, but you should never think it&amp;rsquo;s enough. If you lock yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work will be lost. You may as well not have bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for you to benefit fully from your work, you have to make it known.</description>
