&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let your future disturb you. You will meet if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If sometimes your future haunts you, for me personally someone close to me told a prophecy about me and it haunted me way longer than it should, hence was able to connect to it. IMO these things haunt the weak more than man of actions and yes reading does empower you against such weak thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote from  bhagavad geeta helps me keep on the right track, and yes evening prayers do help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन |
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि || 47 ||&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a right to perform your prescribed duties&lt;/strong&gt;, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the future haunts you, remember, that is not in your control. No worry/stress can solve it. Only things that can help you are your actions and what you choose to do. Remember the only thing that is in your control are your actions coupled with weapons/fruit of reason/बुद्धि no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No worry can solve issues other than your actions which are in your control.&lt;/p&gt;
