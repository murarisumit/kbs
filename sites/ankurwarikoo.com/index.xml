&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">One of the most frequently asked questions to me is: “How do you manage to wake up early?”
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Logic says several answers to it:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Keep your workout gear next to your bed
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Alarm clock in another room
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Burpees on waking up, etc.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">All of these work, until they don’t.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">The true question to address is “How to sleep on time?”
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">If you’re sleeping at 11 and want to wake up at 4, the motivation will certainly stop on Day 4.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">What if we get a night-time schedule, that makes it impossible to sleep late? Something like:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Having dinner 2-3 hours prior to planned bed time
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Spending time doing activities that relax you
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Planning for the next day
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">It turns out, if we turn to twist the outputs without changing the inputs, the motivation won’t lasts.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">The more we strive to get the inputs right, the more the outputs automatically take care of themselves.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Can attest to it, this has been the only thing working for me. If I sleep late, then its better to assume that mornings are gone now, nothing can be done, take it as holiday tomorrow. This also cements the idea in me that &lt;code>my today defines my tomorrow&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mornings are the most beautiful and productive part of the day, and following is my routine, it might help you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday night&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Have dinner by 6:30-7:00 and if it&amp;rsquo;s late go for a fruit diet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read books, listen to music, enjoy time with family, and basically spend time doing activities that relax you (as ankur mentioned).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having milk before sleeping with turmeric is good. Somehow flavour is good to me, also a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosha">khapa guy&lt;/a>, so that works for me, might now work for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan things for tomorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mornings&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wake up by 3:30/4/4:30, pick tasks you&amp;rsquo;ve planned and chop them off. You get beautiful those feel-good feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go and see the sun rise, for me it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful and other &lt;a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/beautiful">adjectives&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise after saying &lt;strong>hi&lt;/strong> to the sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook food and be happy as you are so lucky to have that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before eating, take a bath and freshen up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat food and now the day starts for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan is to add morning prayers into this, but don&amp;rsquo;t have a pooja room in the house(have to do something for it.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Afternoon&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This time is sold to someone else for money(sad but that&amp;rsquo;s case for now[27-Aug-2021])&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If I sleep late,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No fun mornings, admitting I have missed all of that for today.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No alarm, but body sleep is important to me, no alarm to disturb it. Have done my deeds. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, let this morning go. Nothing can be done about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you can try to do something meaningful during the day, do that and remember most importantly sleep on time to enjoy your next morning.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>You get up every morning.&lt;br>
You show up.&lt;br>
You do the right things.&lt;br>
You work really really hard.&lt;br>
Don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t beg, don’t lie.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here is the honest truth – People don’t care!&lt;br>
People don’t care if you are doing the right thing.&lt;br>
They only care if you are doing the right thing for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>tldr : If they care they care, if they don&amp;rsquo;t they don&amp;rsquo;t and that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be once concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Truely, it makes sense people would only care if you do right thing for them&lt;/strong>, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t concern us. It is not in our control, so why worry in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reason for doing sometime should be because &lt;strong>you care&lt;/strong> not because someone else does. Personally learnt it hard way that people pleasing or doing because someone else wants/cares is stupid idea. For me personally, it was because I had low self-respect for myself.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
