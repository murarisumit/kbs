Are you frustrated that the world wants you to pick one thing, because you want to do them all?
*The problem is thinking short term* — assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t happen.
**The solution is to think long term**.
Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another.
You may have heard this story:
Buridan’s donkey is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water.
It keeps looking left and right, trying to decide between hay and water.
Unable to decide, it eventually dies of hunger and thirst.
A donkey can’t think of the future.
If he could, he’d realize he could first drink the water, then go eat the hay. He’d live.
Don’t be a donkey.
You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Think ahead. Plan. Use the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and under-estimate what they can do in ten years.
Think long-term. Use the future.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
