      <description>Hayden: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfksYTFzY5M Point is made was cricket was a big threatre for him, and live broadcasted threatre. He gave his performance and fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t saw cricket or any game on those lines before. He made it feel like art form.

      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>
