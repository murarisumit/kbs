      <title>Financial Freedom: Skills First Than Money</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guy is simple to understand, no out of the world quotations. Can relate to him, seems like a neighbourhood elder brother(bhaiya) who you can talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he mentioned was, spend on skills. More like one message in a 3-idiot movie. Run after excellence, success &amp;amp; peace of mind will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All for peace of mind. If a house gives peace of mind, improves quality of life, go buy a house. If cars make your life easy, use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing he mentioned is, we have to make money work for us to be financially independent and financial freedom is about being content. There are endless materialistic traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to few more bits to the post. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvBZjKXVyP8&amp;t=399s&#34;&gt;There are three important assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to optimise on these three bits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perception Is Reality</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/b4623554b68ff4565baac8390eee35e5/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was writing a few posts on being a man of actions, not being scared of the future and remembering only action matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B/586a1c7bfad52e25a95e1d7d9654157a/&#34;&gt;Not scared of future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kbs.murarisumit.in/9aed16443012e51a38b0c189b58f95ab&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Not What I Am Underneath it&amp;rsquo;s What I Do Defines Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from notion kbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence is the key, if you believe in you the world will believe in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perception is reality, how people perceive you is how they behave around you and that is real, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if their perception is an accurate depiction of you or not because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. People do action, real world action based on it. Hence the &lt;strong&gt;Perception is reality or Perception becomes the reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt it the hard way, when people perceive you in a certain way and action, real actions are taken because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people perceive of you are from your actions, at least this is the case with me. Your thoughts are not visible out there, only your actions. You can speak of your intention, and some people may buy it but not for long. Actions are more powerful than words.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Dark Knight Rises the Climb Scene</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One more youtube video, batman this time. This scene might have given goose bumps to Roger Federer too, you may fall but it&amp;rsquo;s what you choose afterwards that matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the dialogue from rocky comes to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ain&amp;rsquo;t about how hard you hit; It&amp;rsquo;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American nationalism had brought beautiful movies out there and something to learn from. Deserters/Refugees coming from every parts of world and joining together and making a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; nation. Nation making is huge task, India still isn&amp;rsquo;t a nation yet despite such commonality, history and culture, but American built nation from deserters, some refugees true but most deserters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always in awe to see to see American might and what they have achieved. They really are a nation to look upto.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jordan Peterson Successful Men Are Insane and Work All the Time</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/ce39966c39f2ea7d1a55946669a84685/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He said in one of his interviews that men wrote to him and told that he changed his life. I&amp;rsquo;m one of such characters. Here also a lot of thanks goes to people who made the internet happen, so I could watch his lessons/lectures or speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve to be highly successful in corporate world i.e. reach at high position in social order one has to put insane amount of work, he mentioned 80 hours work week, translates to ~ 12 hours every day without breaks for years and with &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;determination&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~hello~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t like when kids go to work to the library to study for 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High social order always means different from different cultures. India had a weird culture once, people who left the material world and lived for pursuit of knowledge were treated on high pecking order, but that is for a very evolved state of culture. Mostly it would refer to high financial or political position.
Disclaimer: Today India is in a very sad state w.r.t its culture and the same system has become the biggest baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Will Mahatma Gandhi be treated in a higher social order than Bill Gates or Sir Albert Einstein ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One needs to make decision,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either earn good enough money to enjoy life and then learn music, take care of body, tap-dancing, beautiful literature, learning physics, getting close to oneself/god&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be insane and work like crazy and get up in pecking order&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or third he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention having a middle ground, keep working your whole life because you enjoy it and reach in high pecking order. While taking care of your body, mind, being calm and happy all along in life. Is this route possible ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8&#34;&gt;Happiness Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; had a very huge impact on me, during my college years, but is this route possible? &lt;strong&gt;This would good exploration in my life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    So goal of life is to explore this third route&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3D printing is in nascent stages India, but seeing rocket being made out of this tech is so motivating and makes you look in future about possibility and how would it look like. Also thoughts come to mind, that why aren&amp;rsquo;t thing like electric 2-wheelers, drones, houses in India are using it, but then answer comes even more quickly, that people like are in jobs instead of innovating out there, so how would the change happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bayes Rule and Medical Tests</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/bayes-rule-medical-tests/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 08:54:42 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/bayes-rule-medical-tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All medical tests do is update their probability of having disease, and not tell if we have disease or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevalence  : How common is that disease around here? What chance of having it without tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitivity : If even disease is present, how good is the test at detecting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specificity : If a test is taken, there can be other issues that result. Clots in the pancreas can be because of a lot many things. How specific is test for that specific disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example which he told&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevalence : 1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitivity : 90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specificity : 91%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken test, there is &lt;strong&gt;1%&lt;/strong&gt; chance of you having that disease. So taking a test based on the test&amp;rsquo;s Sensitivity and Specificity would increase and decrease that probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate your probability faster is to get the Bayes factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Bayes factor = Sensitivity / False positive
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Bayes factor =  (Probability of having cancer after test is positive) / (Probability of not having cancer after test is positive)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayes factor is also called likelihood ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For above values :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of having cancer after test is positive : 90 in 100 (90%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of test is false positive (100 - specificity) i.e 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So likelihood ratio is : 90 / 0 i.e. 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the first case without test, there was 1% i.e. 1 in 100 that you&amp;rsquo;ve cancer without test. After the test, your chances just get updated. After test is positive your chances are:  1/100 * 10 ~ 1/10. So that is also not 100% sure now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for tests your symptoms, contacts, genetics all come up to increase the chance, but still not 100%, we need to remember. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;All tests do is update the chances of having it, but not sure shot thing. Until tests are bulletproof.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-to-watch-the-whole-video-above-are-just-notes-taken-from-there&#34;&gt;Better to watch the whole video, above are just notes taken from there.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of top comments for youtube channel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a doctor I&amp;rsquo;m so happy you&amp;rsquo;re using your platform to get this information out. Let me tell you though&amp;hellip; it gets way more complicated! Unfortunately prevalence estimates aren&amp;rsquo;t always known and are constantly changing (especially in pandemics). Another thing to consider is the gold standard. If your test looks for breast cancer you can cut out the lump and look at it under a microscope. Some diseases aren&amp;rsquo;t as easily clarified. For instance, since we don&amp;rsquo;t have a highly accurate, easy test for pancreatic cancer we rely on imaging, demographics, blood markers, symptoms (or lack thereof) as multiple things that form a conglomerate test to increase our Bayes factor. Despite all these things we can&amp;rsquo;t always get a great prediction on whether that scar in your bile duct is cancer or just a residual scar from pancreatitis you had 10 years ago. So we offer the patient a huge surgery to remove the head of their pancreas and duodenum only to find that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cancer. You can imagine the patient is happy it&amp;rsquo;s not cancer but not so happy they don&amp;rsquo;t have half their pancreas and have abdominal pain and maybe diabetes. Medicine is a tricky thing. Another tricky thing is operator error. Some tests depend on the skill of the lab tech, radiologist, or surgeon. The complexity of the human body and the uniqueness of each individual also plays a role. Your test may be false positive in a particular patient 100% of the time because they have some strange protein mutation. It&amp;rsquo;s tough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is made was cricket was a big threatre for him, and live broadcasted threatre. He gave his performance and fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t saw cricket or any game on those lines before. He made it feel like art form.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.&lt;/p&gt;
