      <description>Hayden: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfksYTFzY5M Point is made was cricket was a big threatre for him, and live broadcasted threatre. He gave his performance and fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t saw cricket or any game on those lines before. He made it feel like art form.

      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t give up because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, if you love it: &amp;ldquo;do it&amp;rdquo;. It has to be done with joy, there is no point of adding more misery to our little world
Work should be done because you want to do it, you like it. It would bring best from you, else whole point of living life miserably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. No point of doing work which you don&amp;rsquo;t like in life, that life is not a full life, and life should be lived fully, joyfully.</description>
