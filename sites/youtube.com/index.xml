      <description>He said in one of his interviews that men wrote to him and told that he changed his life. I&amp;rsquo;m one of such characters. Here also a lot of thanks goes to people who made the internet happen, so I could watch his lessons/lectures or speeches.
To achieve to be highly successful in corporate world i.e. reach at high position in social order one has to put insane amount of work, he mentioned 80 hours work week, translates to ~ 12 hours every day without breaks for years and with focus and determination.</description>

      <description>This guy is simple to understand, no out of the world quotations. Can relate to him, seems like a neighbourhood elder brother(bhaiya) who you can talk to.
What he mentioned was, spend on skills. More like one message in a 3-idiot movie. Run after excellence, success will come to you. He isn&amp;rsquo;t sadhu and adds on to say to buy material assets like cars or houses. If a house gives peace of mind, improves quality of life, go buy a house.</description>

      <description>3D printing is in nascent stages India, but seeing rocket being made out of this tech is so motivating and makes you look in future about possibility and how would it look like. Also thoughts come to mind, that why aren&amp;rsquo;t thing like electric 2-wheelers, drones, houses in India are using it, but then answer comes even more quickly, that people like are in jobs instead of innovating out there, so how would the change happen.</description>

      <description>All medical tests do is update their probability of having disease, and not tell if we have disease or not.
There are three things
 Prevalence : How common is that disease around here? What chance of having it without tests? Sensitivity : If even disease is present, how good is the test at detecting it. Specificity : If a test is taken, there can be other issues that result. Clots in the pancreas can be because of a lot many things.</description>

      <description>Hayden: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfksYTFzY5M Point is made was cricket was a big threatre for him, and live broadcasted threatre. He gave his performance and fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t saw cricket or any game on those lines before. He made it feel like art form.

      <description>Astrology has always intrigued me, specifically indian style of astrology, have heard a lot about it. Lunar calendar and rituals and traditions around it always facinate me a lot. I have some longing for it.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on it much, but this video again brings those question back to me.
Path for me is language first, will have to learn sanskrit first, then i would have lot of venues open to me.</description>
