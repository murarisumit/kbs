You can make a leaders out of man with reasonable common-sense and decency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Most of part is taken from summarized transcript by fellow youtuber at video with little changes from my side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to manekshaw sir qualities of leader&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Professional competence&lt;/strong> : He provided example of Defence Minister. That minister had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it.&lt;/strong> : 👉🏻 Act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong. 👉🏻 why a person don’t take decision?? because he lacks confidence!! why? because he lacks professional knowledge. 👉🏻 If you must be a &lt;strong>bloody fool&lt;/strong> be must quickly - manekshawism
Absolute justice and impartiality: People may not like you but you would be respected.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Courage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 moral courage: Ability to distinguish right from wrong. Then standby it, irrespective of what others think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 yes man, is a horrible man. He may rise very high, but will never become leader. He will be used by superior and disliked by colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 He mentioned story, when he was summoned. This was during east Pakistan crisis, by Indira Gandhi and cabinet ministers. Cabinet ministers in meeting expected him to be agree to intervene in april month. This not prudent and he boldly put forward his dissent about choice of time rather than being yes-man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉🏻 physical courage: Everyone is scared, he tells he was scared too. To be a leader, one to have to physical courageous in face of adversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He mentioned a story, where his subordinate threatened that he would kill him. That chap was big but he despite being scared, he made him santri for night. Also asked him to bring tea and hot water to him in morning. He had option to have more security around him, but he showed he has courage and also showing trust in his men. Funnily he goes on to say, don’t be fool-hardy like he was but we need to understand the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Loyalty&lt;/strong> : Its two way thing, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he is also loyal to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management of men and sources: He mostly conveyed about role of emotional intelligence. Human have problems so being stern should be combined with human touch and sense of humour play a great role in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Discipline and Character&lt;/strong> No amount leadership would put things right, the two other important aspect(that we usually lack)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>👉🏻 Discipline&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discipline is code of conduct for decent living in society one with the other. This code of conduct has come from generation to generation, it’s come from holy books. It gets refined on as cultures change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Example: Non-punctuality is an act of ill-discipline. Very harmful for society and nation.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>👉🏻 Character&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should be honest, truthful etc. The big picture is, knowing what you are. Do not let fans or hangers-on put you on pedestals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Do watch the video, if you have time. You can learn lessons on how to communicates. Sweet little jokes he cracks, makes it far insightful than above mentioned transcript&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

One should not. To add-in man should be harmless either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should be dangerous and monstrous but in civilised manner. All the human we look up to aren&amp;rsquo;t harmless. Shri Ram is great archer and capable to defeating whole kingdom. Shri krishna said to have single handedly changed course of mahabharata.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have all heard stories of third eye of shiva. His ange can bring havoc. The message is harmless men are not virtuous. It&amp;rsquo;s the dangerous man under control that are virtuous and human to look upto.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Company Similar to East India Company</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/c5b650102aad591b71ded2fea2a20d69/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 19:41:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/c5b650102aad591b71ded2fea2a20d69/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company">United fruit company&lt;/a>. Created railroads, port, and other infra in Central American countries for plundering them. Owning the entire supply chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy to draw comparison to what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company&lt;/a> did in India but on the smaller scale. Not killing millions of people, but still very brutal for any human being. I see them and see Hitler and can&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still can see how people think United fruit company and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company&lt;/a> were the force of good. They did good for those countries they were plundering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This video also shows the side where we see how US imperialism works. How they destabilize the country. Quite an eye-opener for someone who grew up to see the USA as a sort-of force of good and democracy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Can Every Devices Be Hacked</title><link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/92a571b39b7be2d430f2391c21c79018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 13:35:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/92a571b39b7be2d430f2391c21c79018/</guid><description>&lt;p>So yes, if someone is really persistant about it.

&lt;p>What all you can do ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Browser has huge attack surface. If you can disable JS, probably disabling javascript, but that seems difficult. Use umatrix can make it easy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disable just-in time compiler, or webassembly or browser if you can.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t click stupid links.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use multi-factor auth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Password managers.&lt;/li>

Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Because of distraction, you actually context switch from one task to other, which lower your focus on work you&amp;rsquo;re doing or we can say one is not able to deliver to our fullest potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to deliver our fullest potential, psychological effect like anxiety, distress chip in, which are far more disastrous for short and long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It also starts a vicious cycle, the more anxiety and distress we feel the more we go for these distractions. In the short-term we don&amp;rsquo;t see problems, we play games, enjoy movies, adore photos, but the problem doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Problems are still there, and we have even less time to solve them than before. This is a far more powerful/dangerous enemy than smoke ever was, because we don&amp;rsquo;t even need to go shop for this, it&amp;rsquo;s at our smartphone, just next to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This continuous loop, then reduces our ability to focus and concentrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So the problem is defined and most of us are aware of it and we need solutions. One such technique if you have lower focus time is to use pomodoro technique, created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short note on pomodoro technique which helps me&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fix tasks you want to work on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work in done is this timebox manner: &lt;strong>loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15 )&lt;/strong> OR &lt;strong>loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15-)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus work for 25 mins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take 5 mins break, no phones here, usually a little walk, sometimes water and relax at times&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continue this for 3 times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take a longer break for the 4th time. Continue and repeat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I good line that i need to keep in check is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo;
His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One thing that i read long back was:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you want someone to be open to you, go ask for some favour, once people have done favor they are more open to talk to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not sure if above is good advice, never understood it properly, so please try at your own risk, but that goes by the same theory mentioned in first quote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not in alignment with his ideas, sounds good though. Got similar thoughts with brahma kumaris(&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8)&lt;/a>, still not in agreement with it. Love if feeling(people say), which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand and not sure what this work exactly mean. Care I understand, responsibility I comprehend, but not sure of Love.&lt;/p>
