      <description>External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>
