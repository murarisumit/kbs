      <title>Dangerous Man Not Virtuous</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t harm anyone, which it right. One should not. To add-in man should be harmless either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be dangerous and monstrous but in civilised manner. All the human we look up to aren&amp;rsquo;t harmless. Shri Ram is great archer and capable to defeating whole kingdom. Shri krishna said to have single handedly changed course of mahabharata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all heard stories of third eye of shiva. His ange can bring havoc. The message is harmless men are not virtuous. It&amp;rsquo;s the dangerous man under control that are virtuous and human to look upto.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Company Similar to East India Company</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/c5b650102aad591b71ded2fea2a20d69/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company&#34;&gt;United fruit company&lt;/a&gt;. Created railroads, port, and other infra in Central American countries for plundering them. Owning the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to draw comparison to what &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt; did in India but on the smaller scale. Not killing millions of people, but still very brutal for any human being. I see them and see Hitler and can&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still can see how people think United fruit company and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company&#34;&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt;  were the force of good. They did good for those countries they were plundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video also shows the side where we see how US imperialism works. How they destabilize the country. Quite an eye-opener for someone who grew up to see the USA as a sort-of force of good and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So yes, if someone is really persistant about it. The prices for these weaponised exploit start from 100K USD from from 2.5Million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is high cost to it, so usually used by state actor or for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t live in fear of getting hacked, it should be in your threat model. There are lot more important people our there with more information is their hands so you&amp;rsquo;re very less likely are a target, but remember if someone wants to he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is pure economics involved, will it bring enough ROI(Return of investment on it). Are you a person of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all you can do ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser has huge attack surface. If you can disable JS, probably disabling javascript, but that seems difficult. Use umatrix can make it easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable just-in time compiler, or webassembly or browser if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t click stupid links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use multi-factor auth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack persistance is hard, but just restart it every now and then. It might help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most simpler tricks are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtm4X6L_Cs&#34;&gt;Phishing&lt;/a&gt; you should be worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leadership Lecture Sam Manekshaw</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/leadership-lecture-field-marshall-sam-mannekshaw/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 09:41:06 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/leadership-lecture-field-marshall-sam-mannekshaw/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He believes leaders are not born, you can make a leaders out of man with reasonable common-sense and decency and rest of portion he then mentions attributes of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of part is taken from summarized transcript by fellow youtuber at video with little changes from my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;according-to-manekshaw-sir-qualities-of-leader&#34;&gt;According to manekshaw sir qualities of leader&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional competence&lt;/strong&gt; :
He provided example of Defence Minister who had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it&lt;/strong&gt; :
👉🏻 act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong.
👉🏻 why a person don&amp;rsquo;t take decision?? because he lacks confidence!! why?  because he lacks professional knowledge !
👉🏻 if you must be a bloody fool be must quickly - manekshawism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute justice and impartiality&lt;/strong&gt;
By this way you may not be liked by all but be respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 moral courage:  ability to distinguish right from wrong and standby it irrespective of what others think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 yes man, is horrible man, he may rise very high, but will never become leader, he will be used by superior and disliked by colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻(he mentioned story, when he was summoned, during east Pakistan crisis, by Indira Gandhi and other cabinet minister who expected him to be agree to intervene in april month, which was not prudent and he boldly put forward his dissent about choice of time rather than being yesman )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 physical courage:
Everyone is scared, he tells he was scared too. To be a leader, one to have to physical courageous in face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentioned a story, where his subordinate threatened that he would kill him, that chap was big but he despite being scared. He made him santri for night and asked him to bring tea and hot water to him in morning. He had option to have more security around him, but he showed he has courage and also showing trust in his men. Funnily he goes on to say, don&amp;rsquo;t be fool-hardy like he was but we need to understand the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt;
Its two way thing, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he is also loyal to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of men and sources&lt;/strong&gt;
He mostly conveyed about role of emotional intelligence, that human have problems so being stern should be combined with human touch and sense of humour play a great role in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discipline and Character&lt;/strong&gt;
No amount leadership would put things right, the two other important aspect(that we usually lack)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉🏻Discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline is code of conduct for decent living in society one with the other
This code of conduct has come from generation to generation, it&amp;rsquo;s come from holy books and refined on as cultures change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Non-punctuality is an act of ill-discipline. Very harmful for society and nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 Character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be honest, truthful etc. The big picture is, &lt;strong&gt;knowing what you are&lt;/strong&gt;, not let fans or hangers-on put you on pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do watch the video, if you have time. You can learn lessons on how to communicates and sweet little jokes he cracks, which make it far insightful then above mentioned transcript&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understand Electricity Generation</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/understand-electricity-generation/</link>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/understand-electricity-generation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This video actually helps us understand how electricity is generated by using magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When studies electricity for first time, never understood where does frequency mean, what current is, what does voltage mean and simple things like this and whole electrical energy didn&amp;rsquo;t made sense to me. Now most of it does, probably if I go for advanced study would really make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bigger Impact of Distraction More Than Just Time Lost</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/bigger-impact-for-distraction-more-than-just-time-lost/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 09:48:58 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/bigger-impact-for-distraction-more-than-just-time-lost/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow reached to this tacky/clickbaity title &amp;ldquo;How the smartphone is destroying you from inside&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjC245ugW8&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjC245ugW8&lt;/a&gt;. Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of distraction, you actually context switch from one task to other, which lower your focus on work you&amp;rsquo;re doing or we can say one is not able to deliver to our fullest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to deliver our fullest potential, psychological effect like anxiety, distress chip in, which are far more disastrous for short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also starts a vicious cycle, the more anxiety and distress we feel the more we go for these distractions. In the short-term we don&amp;rsquo;t see problems, we play games, enjoy movies, adore photos, but the problem doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Problems are still there, and we have even less time to solve them than before. This is a far more powerful/dangerous enemy than smoke ever was, because we don&amp;rsquo;t even need to go shop for this, it&amp;rsquo;s at our smartphone, just next to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continuous loop, then reduces our ability to focus and concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problem is defined and  most of us are aware of it and we need solutions. One such technique if you have lower focus time is to use pomodoro technique, created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short note on pomodoro technique which helps me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix tasks you want to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in done is this timebox manner: &lt;strong&gt;loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15 )&lt;/strong&gt; OR &lt;strong&gt;loop(25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 15-)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus work for 25 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take 5 mins break, no phones here, usually a little walk, sometimes water and relax at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue this for 3 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a longer break for the 4th time. Continue and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was good to see nice laptops coming in now. Which have this repairability in mind. This laptop specially looks with it&amp;rsquo;s modularity. As iFixit says, this is slippery slope, we have seen many such initiatives come and go. So hoping this company works and changes consumer electronics industry for good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Not Love</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 10:12:30 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This youtube video(click the title, that is how bookmarks are arranged for all posts), is of Abraham Joshua Heshel Twerski, an Israeli-American Hasidic rabbi, a scion of the Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty, and a psychiatrist specializing in substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I good line that i need to keep in check is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is  you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo;
His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that i read long back was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want someone to be open to you, go ask for some favour, once people have done favor they are more open to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure if above is good advice, never understood it properly, so please try at your own risk, but that goes by the same theory mentioned in first quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in alignment with his ideas, sounds good though. Got similar thoughts with brahma kumaris(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8),&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dNPNtdaMWY&amp;amp;list=PLCE9046E85D3918D8),&lt;/a&gt; still not in agreement with it. Love if feeling(people say), which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand and not sure what this work exactly mean. Care I understand, responsibility I comprehend, but not sure of Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was listening to thismusic in college, today there was discussion and flamenco again came up. It was sweet memory lane to go and also happy to see this video is still there in youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How intrusive youtube-ads are, but is does provide value of society. Not sure if we have any way to store music forever like we have books for text.&lt;/p&gt;
