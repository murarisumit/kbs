      <title>Bigger Impact of Distraction More Than Just Time Lost</title>

      <description>Somehow reached to this tacky/clickbaity title &amp;ldquo;How the smartphone is destroying you from inside&amp;rdquo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjC245ugW8. Probably from the past few days, putting my head to these distractions. They seem to me like modern day alcoholic drinks. You enjoy it and forget your problems, similar promises made by alcoholic drinks.
So the point video makes is, the time we invest in these addictive systems(there whole KPI is to make stay people on their website) is anyways gone, but there are more far reaching impact because of it.</description>

      <title>Finally Some Sense in Laptops</title>

      <description>It was good to see nice laptops coming in now. Which have this repairability in mind. This laptop specially looks with it&amp;rsquo;s modularity. As iFixit says, this is slippery slope, we have seen many such initiatives come and go. So hoping this works time and changes consumer electronics industry for good.
Kudos to https://frame.work/ team.</description>

      <title>What Is Not Love</title>
      <link>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</link>

      <guid>https://kbs.murarisumit.in/bookmarks/what-is-not-love/</guid>
      <description>This youtube video(click the title, that is how bookmarks are arranged for all posts), is of Abraham Joshua Heshel Twerski, an Israeli-American Hasidic rabbi, a scion of the Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty, and a psychiatrist specializing in substance abuse.
External-love is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to give, not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to get. (This line is bit vague)
I good line that i need to keep in check is:
 &amp;ldquo;People make serious mistake in thinking, that you give to those who you love, and the answer is you love to those whom you give&amp;rdquo; His point is, if I give something to you, I have invested myself in you, since self-love is given everybody loves themselves, now that part of me has become in you, there is part of me in you that I love.</description>

      <description>Was listening to thismusic in college, today there was discussion and flamenco again came up. It was sweet memory lane to go and also happy to see this video is still there in youtube.
How intrusive youtube-ads are, but is does provide value of society. Not sure if we have any way to store music forever like we have books for text.</description>

      <description>Most of part is taken from summarized transcript by fellow youtuber at video
According to manekshaw sir qualities of leader   professional competence : He provided example of Defence Minister who had no idea about howitzer, motor etc how can he lead the army officers !!
  ability to take a decision and take a full responsibility for it : üëâüèª act of omission is much worse than act of commission of wrong.</description>
